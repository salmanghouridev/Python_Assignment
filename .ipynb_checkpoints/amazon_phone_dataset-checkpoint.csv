With a beautiful infinity V-cut display, a wide angle camera and a powerful processor, the Galaxy M10 is a powerful smartphone.","13MP+5MP ultra-wide angle dual camera | 5MP f2.0 front camera.

Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone 👌***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast.

I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few***Nice Phone in the segment of Budget Phone. Superb Look. with Type C Fast Charger and Type C earphone in the box.

Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3.

Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***"

I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!***READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few***Nice Phone in the segment of Budget Phone. Superb Look. with Type C Fast Charger and Type C earphone in the box. Running Smooth.***Plz avoid buying ....1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...***1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3. For me non existence of 3.5 mm headphone jack is just not a big deal***Worst camera and ear piece is really horrible.. There is no Samsung pay also.. Honestly the worst phone to buy***"

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)***No EarPhone In Box And Mobile Cover Of Samsung M30.Samsung Provide Earphones in 2k Mobiles, But Here It's Missing.

Next is, it has Dual SIM slots and a dedicated slot for memory card.Samsung M30 hasExynos 7904 Processor1.8 GHz Octa Core Processor & 4GB RAM - multitask gaming, videos, etc.***Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone.

Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6.

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it😊***Good phone. Fast delivery by amazon.Pros1 camera quality both selfie and back are awesome2. Battery back up is good3.Good buid quality4 finger print and face unlock both works smooth5 network connectivity and internet speed better than other phone like samsung MICons1 no fast charger take almost 2 hour to charge 100 percent2 no ear phone3 no fast charger4 no notification led***Camera is not as expected its like a 13 mp....

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

But my opinion is they are expecting the performance of a iPhone in this mobile(brainless people) . You paid only 5k and expecting 50k experience this is bullshit. Now let me come to the review part. This mobile is good value for money.battery is too good. Performance is decent for a 5k mobile. And the overall performance is good. Camera is not that good. Fingerprint sensor works nicely. Build quality is decent. Speaker is too good. This is my honest review.***Nice but screen***The phone is worth the money. Good performance, the camera quality is average(which doesn't bother me as I don't use it much). The battery life is incredible on a normal use it stands two days. The heating problem written in other comments does not happen while using the phone , except while using it while charging , which is not suitable for any phone's life. The packaging was good and delivered before date. Altogether its worth the money at this price range***Very wrost mobile. From the 1st day itself its not working properly. Not even a proper support from amazon service. Smartcheck app shows that there is no problem in the phone but the performance of the phone is very wrost. Touch is not properly working. Hanging, heating, speakers are not even good. Very very worst mobile. Please don’t buy this***Mobile is too poor quality its getting too heated while on calling n while chargingI want to return it back***"

Though cassual games will be ok.▶ Already using 2 of 16 gb versions, my suggestion will be to get 32 gb internal, as sooner or later 16 gb runs out of space and you need to uninstall things to install others. Current apps n content consume a lot of space.▶ Even after launch of Redmi 7 series, 6A is still in shelves for a reason. It offers quice decent feature set & performance in its price bracket. None of the current devices can beat its price point.

Yet another great product from Nokia.Thanks for the ontime delivery too.***Sound quality: Good. Battery life: maximum 40 hours with internet or wifi ON. Durability: no comments, it's Nokia for God's sake.In few words, this phone is best for people who don't play HD games or use their phones for excessive photo capturing. Rest, this phone provides all the functionality of voice and best quality video calling via Duo, WhatsApp, Telegram, FB messenger. digital payment options with GooglePay and Paytm. Online entertainment with YouTube Go, JioCinema( login with Jio credentials mandatory), Transportation with OLA lite and Google Maps go. Thank God there's no inbuilt browser except Google chrome which we can disable or best - uninstall and replace with the Lite version of any browser we like. Of course, you cannot expect a 1 GB RAM phone to honor your 64 MB browser requirements alongside 3 other apps in multitasking mode which itself use 10- 30 MB of RAM.For phone security, it gives 3 universal options- PIN, Pattern and Password.Oh and 1 more thing I have also installed candy crush saga on this phone which works absolutely fine without any crash or hanging issues while chatting on Telegram.I don't think anyone with medium essential requirements of a phone shouldn't purchase this phone.***It's a smart, bright-coloured handy phone suitable for elderly people and those graduating from feature+keypad phones to smart+touchphones. It's 1GB RAM is slow and steady and average touchscreen experience makes it easy for newbies. Poor battery standby and low quality screen resolution, considering they have thought of a functional Oreo OS variant but compromised on these hardware. Bare minimum internal storage of just 8GB, of which we get a little below 4GB free to use as the rest is taken by the system OS. All in all, a laboured purchase decision, given the compact screen size, price point and keeping other budget requirements in mind. I bought it for my mom so that she can use a Jio 4G SIM. While all other brands are moving to a somewhat eco-friendly all-glass body this handset is a polycarbonate one, at that. And, by the way, I have stuck a tempered glass protector as this handset's facia has no known protective shield. Lastly ,I have added a photo of the handset as proof of purchase, as requested for Amazon reviews. You can, in fact, see my silhouette on the screen!***Overall phone is gooood at this price.the phone is go edition therefore it has only go apps preinstalled.but u can install apps as u like.1.Some apps on playstore are not running on this phone.2.This phone is sutaible for elders but not for young people coz no high quality games are run due to 1gb ram.3.Last main thing is that the phone has vga screen and has less pixels.so it is not sutaible for viewing movies.4. 5mp camera and 2mp front are average.5.Battery backup is very nice.6.speker is very loud.thats a better.Overall the phone is good for elders and very beautifuly designed by King of mobiles NOKIA.Glad to know it is made in india***I wouldn't rate even 1 Star as the Phone is Pathetic Soud Quality is so Poor not able to Hear and Screen Resolution is is So Bad we may get into Sight Defection and the Return Policy is Not to the Satisfactorylevel as AMAZON says Electronic can't be Returned Back but How is this Possible without seeing the Product we have Brought and on Dissatisfaction on the requirements how can we live with it I suggest not to Buy Electronic Items through Online if this is the Policy***Very easy to use. Almost stock android. Android one programme and a smooth android experience. No hang and lag even though 1GB RAM. Always a favourite company ""THE NOKIA"".

Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4. Display is pretty awesome and sound quality superb in this device1.8 gb ram are available out of 4 gb and 48 gb storage available out of 64 gbFinger print and face unlock is super first over all nice product go for it😊***Good phone.

(ha)- Phone feels amazing in the hand- Durability of this thing is on point, designed to last instead of break.- Speaker sounds not up to mark and even volume.- Design part I love it very muchCon's- Picture quality not good they given13 MP Rear camera | 5 MP front camera.- Stock camera software is extremely basic, enough for most users but weak for those looking for those great shots.- Screen size is not 5.5 inch.- Processor can get a little hung up every once and a while but it's barely noticeable.- Phone feels so nice that putting a case on it just feels bad encouraging you not to protect it and you should always use protection.- It doesn't make me breakfast.Overall, what Redmi phone does not everything but it’s budget friendly phone.***Android Oreo 8 itself required 2GB RAM and consuming entire RAM. no memory for applications. Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.***I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same  or better than its ancestor .But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me***The Service center service at MI is very bad, You go with one problem and come back with many other issues, samsung or oppo phone, service is the best thats what my friends say, Mi may look attractive with the price tag, but after sales is service is not good experience, think twice before buying MI Phones.***5A is far better than this.Full screen display is a bogus thing.No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.Lags within the first 5 days.Even hanged for a very short while!3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?Don't like MIUI.As usual no earphone.As usual small cable.As usual no gorilla glass.As usual no waterproof coating or anything.Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.***I haven't checked sim 2 after delivery, after few days when I insert sim 2 this was not detected, I visited service centre he said this phone having this issue and need to change PC main board but part is not available. Every alternate days I am calling/visited but answer is same.I am very disappointed that Amazon providing this kind of bad products***Using it from 1 year , its so good , still its in working condition no issue till now .

I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use..

It's 1GB RAM is slow and steady and average touchscreen experience makes it easy for newbies. Poor battery standby and low quality screen resolution, considering they have thought of a functional Oreo OS variant but compromised on these hardware. Bare minimum internal storage of just 8GB, of which we get a little below 4GB free to use as the rest is taken by the system OS. All in all, a laboured purchase decision, given the compact screen size, price point and keeping other budget requirements in mind. I bought it for my mom so that she can use a Jio 4G SIM. While all other brands are moving to a somewhat eco-friendly all-glass body this handset is a polycarbonate one, at that. And, by the way, I have stuck a tempered glass protector as this handset's facia has no known protective shield. Lastly ,I have added a photo of the handset as proof of purchase, as requested for Amazon reviews. You can, in fact, see my silhouette on the screen!***Overall phone is gooood at this price.the phone is go edition therefore it has only go apps preinstalled.but u can install apps as u like.1.Some apps on playstore are not running on this phone.2.This phone is sutaible for elders but not for young people coz no high quality games are run due to 1gb ram.3.Last main thing is that the phone has vga screen and has less pixels.so it is not sutaible for viewing movies.4. 5mp camera and 2mp front are average.5.Battery backup is very nice.6.speker is very loud.thats a better.Overall the phone is good for elders and very beautifuly designed by King of mobiles NOKIA.Glad to know it is made in india***I wouldn't rate even 1 Star as the Phone is Pathetic Soud Quality is so Poor not able to Hear and Screen Resolution is is So Bad we may get into Sight Defection and the Return Policy is Not to the Satisfactorylevel as AMAZON says Electronic can't be Returned Back but How is this Possible without seeing the Product we have Brought and on Dissatisfaction on the requirements how can we live with it I suggest not to Buy Electronic Items through Online if this is the Policy***Very easy to use.

Its small speaker is good for calling purpose, although its small speaker can play music but when connected to headphone or Bluetooth speaker it becomes a music player device and did I mentioned its flawless Bluetooth connectivity! .Fm reception is quite impressive. Good battery backup. The only thing I'm missing is a single dedicated key for torch but its old fashioned dedicated keys are also good, we can set any shortcuts to four dedicated keys, Once set now I have to press keys two times to turn torch on/off. It has video player, image viewer and internet (gprs) but as a smartphone user I don't think I will use these features. I did put my SD card in it and transferred downloaded ringtones and mp3 files via Bluetooth from my smartphone as I found its default ringtones were not loud enough. And yes we can set any mp3 files as ringtones too. Now all is good. This little cutie covers all the basic features as default but I like to cook my own food!Thanks PHILIPS and Thanks Amazon.***In the add, it is clearly mentioned that either FM can be listened loud through speaker or through headphones.  But in the  received one doesn't have wireless FM facility. Only you can listen through headphones. My main purpose of the purchase not fulfilled. Big companies like PHILIPS giving false advertisements, it is ridiculous!***A 1.77 inch or 4.50 TFR colour display phone with a vey efficient and cool price with a1000 mAh battery makes it really works for a very long time even with the removable battery.Battery info - 3.7 volts whereas the charger limit for it is 4.7 volts.While the weight is quite lessPhone weight around 76 grams onlyWhich makes it easy to handle .A life saviour at this price.Dual sim at last makes the phone even better***very nice product by very nice company I love it only one problem there's no vibration as mentioned in feature***Its a very good mobile at such a low price. There are several things I liked about this mobile primarily its sleek design, good quality call and signal reception. Its very light weight making it easy to carry in pocket. The battery life is also good. Feature wise it has all the features which other brands are offering but this one is at a much lower price than its contemporaries. Overall its one of the best in this price segment.***Very nice basic phone. I bought it for my mom. This phone is very fast and look is very awesome. I liked it very much. very handy, good battery backup, good sound clarity. Charge it once in a week and runs for whole 7 days. It has memory card slot, dual sim slots, radio and torch.***it's easily the best phone in this price.The battery is 1000mah which is quite sufficient for 3 days use.The FM radio also works smoothly.I don't think anyone else offer a better working  double sim phone  at this price range.I am gonna another one for my brother.I got a charger with this phone which is also of very good quality.Totally worth it!!!***Ring tone and speker volume was very bad.you're credited only 949 rupees in my account.another Fifty rupees is loss for me..?The product quality is your problem,not me..This is the last in your app.why you cheat customer..?***"

This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5. Affordable as compared to Pro Version6. Amoled Full HD7.Snapdragon 855 SoC***It is so buttery smooth and insanely fast that i don't have words to describe whole experience... Just buy it you won't regret... Its better than OnePlus 7 Pro.***it is getting heated and screen is blinking non stop***Phone stopped working after 2 days. Not switching on. Please don't buy. Also not able to return.***Oneplus, as always packs the pure raw power in their devices. Its slick, fast, smooth and much improved entertainment box now. It has stereo speakers but sadly no aux, along with that the saddest part is, there is no type c to aux dongle. Deducted two stars because of same charging speed as last year and aux missing.****Honest Review*Bought Oneplus 7 in the first sale.Delivered 2 days backUsing OnePlus for the first time. It is  just superb.Not easy to describe OnePlus 7 in a small review.Camera is fantastic.This is the first phone which is faster then the speed of my fingers :p33,000 is a handsome amount but i think this phone is value for money.If you are one who spend his good time using phone then this is best for you. Its processor saves time because now i am able to do work even more faster.Features you can easily check in product description.5/5 for camera.5/5 for processor.5/5 for shape.5/5 overall.***Well, much awaited OnePlus really stood up the wait we all did.I won't go for the pros and cons! I will go with the feel this phone has which it's competitors such as Asus, Redmi, etc doesn't at all.Yes, there are some quirks but still this is valuable smartphone your hard earned money can really buy.Your money will be on the right side with this OnePlus 7, if you're in doubt which phone to buy in 35k budget.. go with this one hands down, eyes closed. This will you that premium feel.Clean crisp display, loud stereo speakers, super fast phone, nicer camera, fastest storage, etc.Pro tip: Install GCam for OnePlus 7 and click pictures as good as pixel phones. Trust me. You'll love your OnePlus more for this. It will significantly improve your phone's camera quality at par with flagships costing 60k.***"

I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon.

It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use..

There are many complains.Service centre will not help you .***I bought this smartphone 4 months ago,Camera is average, battery charges fastly, lowlight camera is not good, sometimes phone lags***I have been using Moto for past 4 years from Moto G2, then G5 and now G6. The G series have evolved very much. Coming to Moto G6.Touch Sensivity:Much improved and curved glass, makes the experience awesome. I prefer to use it, without tempered glass or screen guard, as we will miss the curved glass feel.Speed:No issues. 3GB version is sufficient for non gamers and regular useWeight:Light weight, with plastic back. Metal as in Moto G6 plus , may be bit heavierSound:Sound quality in headphone is excellent, with Dolby.Loud speaker volume is also decent. Ear piece volume should have been even better.Camera:Good at bright lightingsOther feature:C type USB - need migration if you use regular OTG pen driveAccessing power button is bit difficult. but one button navigation helpsHeadphone Jack 3.5mm at bottom, near USB port.Dedicated Memory card slot.I am very much satisfied with the product and looking to know what betterment can be made in next version. Bit challenging to Moto.***Moto G6 purchased on 13 June 2018 is dead by now. It's not responding at all. The phone had suddenly stopped working on 20 Dec 2018 (barely after 6 months), not powering on (with last remaining charge was ~95%). This happened while travelling, leaving disconnected with family & friends. Imagine if you were in a critical situation, I wish nobody should fall in such a situation at all..I don't know if it could be resolved by the motorola service center in Kolkata, despite being within warranty!Please people, don't buy Motorola now if really want to avoid this kind of situation. Their quality products (I used 3 earlier) are no more reliable. Never buy Chinese Motorola products (US motorola was far better as per my earlier experience with Moto devices)!***Before going to buy any product on Amazon every one should think twice due to Amazon's senseless policy. If you buy any product you can't assume the product quality, Right? I bought Moto G6 phone and I want to return that product because the body panel is not up to the mark. It is very delicate. Even camera is also not that much good. But when I tried to return this product they would not allow me. I asked them one question i.e., without seeing the product, how can I assume that is good or bad? But they don't have answer for that question. Because of them I using this mobile against my will.***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone 👌***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***"

Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.*My personal suggestion* Don't buy any phone with 2GB RAM with Android Oreo 8, what ever the hardware configuration may be. You need atleast 3GB RAM.***I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same  or better than its ancestor .But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone2. Camera very very poor quality3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.Redmi this time you failed me***The Service center service at MI is very bad, You go with one problem and come back with many other issues, samsung or oppo phone, service is the best thats what my friends say, Mi may look attractive with the price tag, but after sales is service is not good experience, think twice before buying MI Phones.***5A is far better than this.Full screen display is a bogus thing.No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.Lags within the first 5 days.Even hanged for a very short while!3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?Don't like MIUI.As usual no earphone.As usual small cable.As usual no gorilla glass.As usual no waterproof coating or anything.Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.***I haven't checked sim 2 after delivery, after few days when I insert sim 2 this was not detected, I visited service centre he said this phone having this issue and need to change PC main board but part is not available. Every alternate days I am calling/visited but answer is same.I am very disappointed that Amazon providing this kind of bad products***Using it from 1 year , its so good , still its in working condition no issue till now . Mi Fan***Redmi 6A not good as 5999 mrp veri slow working Totally waste of money product. Screen quality very poor, battery no good***"

It looks gud, gives u feel in hand, comfortable grip and gud performance during games.But contrary to ther statement of best camera phone, this one is the worst. Rear camera images r blurr, hazzy and if u zoom they r very grainy. Color reproduction is poor. In portrait mode nothing works properly, it can't differentiate the object from background. In low light degraded performance persists.Talking about front camera images only look gud but when u zoom the images, output is always grainy even in day light. Night images are intermittent u may c same object with same lights n background appears differently some time they r gud but other times they may b out of focus, hazzy and overall images r always grainy.***Very good phone. I like the display a lot. It is big enough to enjoy videos.***I would say wow for this awesome mobile..Pros: Camera: Front camera is awesome,  Realme gives you a premium front camera on a mid range smartphone. It blurs the background and gives you a better portrait mode than rear camera.Front camera gives you a bright and clear picture even in low light without requiring a front flash.Battery Backup: It has a decent battery backup,  im using this mobile for over a week now and I didn't find the battery to be disappointing, for a normal usage it lasts for 1.5 days easily and on heavy usage it lasts for 1 day.Performance: It has a normal performance, it will not disappoint you but yes it has an average performance not too fast but till now it never gave me any problem in terms of performance.Looks: This is the major reason why people would prefer buying this smartphone, believe me U1 has premium built quality, attractive shining bright colours and no one can say that its a mid range smartphone by its looks.Unlocking: This is the best thing which I loved about U1. Face unlock is the best it also works in low light, I have used oneplus 5t and face unlock is the same on both the smartphones. Everything is outstanding at this price..  Believe me you'll not get all this on a different smartphone for this price.If I compare,  what vivo is giving for 21k, you are getting those features in 12k (Looks, camera, batter life and other features) If you are looking for performance please purchase oneplus, it has best performance in the market.Cons: I dont wish to mention it personally but just want you guys to know that it doesn't have fast charging.There are no other cons..Overall its a best smartphone for this price and***I am using from last 1week.... awesome futures with superb look .... it's tooo better then redmi and other mble in market...... Pros....the water drop display looks rich and amazing display quality. battery charg fast(2hr full charg) and drains slowly even playing pubg continually.....frant and back cemara are best in this proice.Speaker is decent louder as much as we required.best futures of colour os...etcCon's:I can't find till now any cons ..bcz it's roking.....***This phone is nothing less than Realme 2 pro but its also an improved version of realme 2 pro and Color OS. Little Bigger display than Realme 2 pro, battery issue which i faced in Realme 2 pro is fixed in U1. It doesn't drain quickly and charges the phone at an average good time. Selfie camera is awesome and primary camera is slightly better than Realme pro 2. Phone's performance is equally same as realme 2 pro, so cant really say about the processor. Both SD 660 and P70 is winner. Design and built quality is same, nothing metallic, so using the free case which I've received along with it . Facing little data connectivity issue, but cant say if the problem is with the phone, it could be network issue. Didn't receive the earphone in the box. Why phone companies have stopped sending earphones with the phone? I guess, there are very few phones which come up with the in-box earphone. Audio quality is  good, enjoyed the loudness without earphone, better and louder any other phone. The display is not very bright, it could have been slightly bright like Redmi or Huawei's phones. But the video quality is amazing, you'll love watching movies in FHD and the dewdrop notch is so perfect to make your viewing experience fantastic.Few improvements in Color OS. Finally, we can close the notification by simply sliding towards the right side with the finger. Apps' icons are little smaller in comparison with other realme phones.Its been 1 days since I got my hands on the phone, many more things to see and notice on this phone. Will leave my next review in Jan, 2019***1. Battery is awesome2. Rear camera low light performance average but front camera pretty cool3. I played pubg almost 2 and half hour and battery was drain to 92% to 60% good backup while gaming i faced some minor frame drops playing in high graphics settings and its consume 10% battery in 30 minutes4.

The handset is locked onto the base of the phone so that the handset does not fall off the base when mounted on the wall.

I hate all this.Update: This product has some unique problem. It works on single line without any issue but if you want to use as a parallel connection then it creates problem -  either you don't get dial tone or it stops dial tone of your parallel line/instrument. Very surprised. Finding it difficult to fix this issue.***"

Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone. So i will give for design (2/10)=> DisplayThe color of phone is just average. and yes THERE IS NO SCREEN PROTECTION.  so i will give for display (4/10)=> BatteryI like the battery backup of phone. with just 3080mAh battery it perform well.

Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***"

One star less as ring volume not loud enough too listen from bed room (if you place phone in leaving room).***It has sound problem when we receive a call, the sound remains very less i.e. we have to press speaker button to enhance the sound level so that we can listen the caller voice.Otherwise it working is good.***It was working fine for 25 days, but recently we started getting complain of disturbance in sound. We thought initially there is issue in line, we called our service provider, their engineer confirmed that issue is in cordless. We replaced with corded phone and did not find any voice disturbance.It is already more than return window. So we can't do much.Please refrain from buying this set. If you need sample please contact me for demo.***"

The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering ""mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money"". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son.

I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime.

So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. ₹6500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***"

Here is the detailed review of this device withpros and cons ratings. Few camera samples are also attached to thisreview.Pros:-1) Very lightweight2) It looks beautiful and has a huge display3) Nice crisp display4) The infinity V display looks great5) Ultra Wide dual rear camera6) Dedicated Micro SD card slot7) No heating issues8) Face unlock works smoothlyCons:-1) The rear camera is worse2) The back panel of the phone is not that good3) It is not having fast charging support as it is having a USB port.4) No Fingerprint scanner5) Only 2.4Ghz Wifi Support6) Not a PUBG Phone7) Bloatware (Though we can disable them)8) Bigger bottom bezel than M209) 1Amp Charger in the boxRatings:-Design: 7/10Display: 9.5/10Battery: 7/10Back camera: 6/10Front Camera: 7/10Processor: 7/10Call Quality: 8/10Face unlock & Fingerprint: 7/10Speakers: 8/10Pricing: 8.5/10Now let's come to the detailed review:-# Box contents:- In the box, you will get the handset, Chargingadapter, USB cable, Sim ejector tool and user manual.# Design:- The design of M10 is great and I bought the black variant,it looks beautiful in hand and as I said earlier it is an attentiongrabber.# Build Quality:- It is fully made up of plastic & and the back sideof the phone is having plastic finishing but it is polycarbonate andit is very prone to scratches. I will suggest you buy a back cover.# Display:- It is having 16CM (6.3) FHD+ Dewdrop full view display,with broad 90.8% screen-to-body ratio, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and 2.5DGorilla Glass, it gives the screen a premium look. The bezels are lessand the bottom chin is quite very thin which makes the viewing best. Theviewing experience is great and in sunlight the screen is visible.# Battery:- It is loaded with 3400 mAh battery, if you are a moderateuser, it can give you the battery backup for around 1 day or more andif you a gamer (playing high-end games) it can give you a backup forwhole day.* I have charged this phone from 20% to 100% the time taken was 2hours 20 minutes.# Audio:- The speaker of this phone is very crisp and clear. The audiothrough the earphones are just WOW and you will also get an opinionfor the Equalizer in the phone settings.# Performance:- The M10 runs on 1.6 GHz Exynos 7904 octa-coreprocessor. All the high-end games like PUBG, Asphalt 9, Unkilled runsaverage. You cant get winner chicken dinner with this phoneeasily.# Camera:- It is having selfie-5 MP front camera and the rear camerais having 13 MP+5 MP ultra-wide angle dual camera. The front camera worksbest under natural lighting conditions, but the rear camera struggles alot in low light conditions. (I have attached a few camera samples)# Security:- The face unlock is not that fast and we should be as well worried about the security, I've seen few videos on Youtube where users have by-passed it.# Connectivity:- It supports 4G LTE connectivity and in the WiFi, itsupports 2.4GHz routers if you are having a 5GHz router then thisthe phone will not support the frequency (Attached a screenshot and video)# Pricing:- The pricing of M10 starts for ₹7990 ie for the basevariant (2GB + 16GB) and the other variant ie (3GB + 32 GB) is pricedfor ₹8990. If you are looking for a budget smartphone for less than ₹9000 then I will recommend you to go for the 3+32 variant of the Samsung GalaxyM10.#SUMMARY:-If you are in a very tight budget with ₹9000 then I will definitelyrecommend you to buy the 3+32 GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M10because at this price point it offers you good performance(NOT FORHARDCORE GAMING ONLY FOR MODERATE USAGE AND MODERATE GAMING), an okayish build & looks, crisp and clear screen, loud & crisp speakers, a decent dual rear camera and a decent front camera. If you want a good phone with gaming at a budget price range then don’t go for this phone.This phone gives a very nice completion to the many phones out there inthe market like Redmi 6, Redmi 6 pro, etc.I hope my review was helpful!***It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to  catch the customers in the  net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.***Ordered this product in the First Sale. And i have to say samsung has done a really good job in the budget segment. Phone Doesnt look or feel cheap.Pros:-1. price is really competetive with Samsung Branding2. Battery Life is Good3. Screen Looks Great with hd+ Resolution4. front Camera Is good enought for selfies5. phone is light weightCons :-1. Rear Camera is not that great. But still u get a ultra wide lens at entry level smart phone2. No headphones included3. Low internal Storage at base modelAt price of 7990 its a great phone. I just bought this to  review.. U should go with atleast 32gb Model its more practical in daily life. Phone Works Great in day to day life. exysnos 7870 is good enough to  handle daily tasks.. and Samsung Experience 9.5 feels snappy.Technoholic Life***Don't buy this phone. Because phone itself switching off automatically. This phone not switching on please watch the video***Well phone is quite nice in look.Battery performance is excellent.Samsung did really good job in theme .Phone should have an internal app lock as i thinkPros:1 . Display  touch response is excellent.2 . Wide angle camera is quite impressive.3. Batter backup is great .4. Phone runs smooth.5. Boot time is fastCons :1. No led light for notification and charging.2. No time lapse and hdr mode in camera3. Face lock is slow and might work too late in less lighted area.4. Pubg is quite slow in these phone but can play in low settings..5. Front camera is shakky sometimes.***There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.2. Poor body build.3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.***Excellent Phone in this budget. I've gifted it to someone. She likes it very much. Ocean color is awesome. Performance is also very good. Light weighted. Handy Phone.***Amazing mobile for best price happy with product***"

This phone is everything smartphone should not have:1) heating problem2) phone lag3) hopelessly low battery life4) very bad touch sensorAs a customer, I can accept every issue except heating problem which is a health hazard for a customer. There have already been multiple instances of exploding of Samsung phone in the past and overheated battery raises a concern.On top of everything, comes the service of Amazon. So much for the 10-day replacement policy in case of any issue. I have been contacting Amazon for more than 10 days about the issue and they have not been able to identify the issue. Their app is not available in the jurisdiction (sent a screenshot to them and there was no response). A technician visit is scheduled for after 5 days a technician visits and he has not been able to replicate the issue because he didn't have the time for a 30 min call which is when the phone gets heated up. Now it is the responsibility of the customer to install a temperature app, monitor the temperature and the raise the issue only if the temperature rises above 45 degrees Celcius. They seriously hope the user to hold a device at 45 degrees. They should revoke the policy of replacement if they don't want to support the claims of the customer. This will at the very least vanish any false hope that the customer would have while buying the product.***useless phone, don’t buy this display camera is very bad 5k redmi phones are 1000 times better than this phone***PRODUCT IS OK***This is  a good phone than m20 because it has that amoled screen..

(Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud.

It's hanging a lot in phone application. I am getting irritated when I am try to make a call. I need to wait for 30 to 40 seconds in that to most of the time it closing automatically showing phone is not responding. I didn't expect this from one plus.

But its a bit big, afterall 6.7 inches is quite a number and super slippery if used without the case.And I am awestruck by the speed it charges. 😍***No 4G direct video call!! What a mess! Clearly over priced. Display is stunning. Performance stunning. Average battery backup. Over hiped device as usual!! Worst RAM management! Only 2GB RAM is free out of 8GB in most optimized state with all the back ground applications are closed. Next upgrade should solve the RAM management problem and Direct 4G video call feature. Camera is good but not ground breaking at this price tag and as hyped by the company.***"

Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

Samsung branding: so you can expect better after sale support in service center,incase if you need to visit.2. TFT Full HD+ display: though it's not Amoled, but still looks good in outdoor & bright enough, Notch display.3. 5000 mAh battery: With moderate usage, it will last for more than a day. ( with 7-8 hours Screen On Time)4. Widevine L1 support: You can stream HD content from Netflix or Amazon prime video.5. Wide angle camera works well.6. Type C support.7. Dolby atmos & Cam2api support.8, Camera is average.Cons:1. PUBG works in medium settings, but after 20 minutes mobile starts heating, same in case of Asphalt 9.2. Though it supports Fast charging, but still takes 2 & half hours to charge fully.3. Processor is Exynos 7904, which is less powerful than Snapdragon 636.4. You can reduce brightness upto certain level, but if you are using mobile mostly at night or your kids gonna use it, then it will be some serious issue.5. No notification LED.6. Lags while multitasking, it takes few seconds to load app.7. Auto brightness doesn't work properly.8. No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) for front camera while video recording.9. As it has plastic glossy finish, attracts fingerprints easily.Final Words: If you are someone looking to buy mobile for your parents, then this is good choice.But If buying for gaming and performance then this is not the right choice, Don't buy it.If need, Will edit review, after using for few days.***Pros: Cheap, Screen size, weight, Audio clarity in headset, Smooth OS (4 GB Model).Cons:1) Lot of junk samsung pre installed apps. No option to uninstall.2) Even though phone had 5000 mah battery hardly get getting 1 day backup with 6 hours sot.( only 8 apps installed other than pre installed like whatsapp, outlook, facebook, myjio, jio tv and 3 bank apps)3) Camera quality is very poor. Painting effect is more in photos if we zoom.4) Phone gets overheated if we watch youtube or in memory movies more than 40 to 50 minsAfter disabling 6 Samsung apps my phone backup increased. Now I am getting more than 1.5 days battery. Around 2 GB free ram. OS is very smooth.After 3 daysDisabled all Samsung inbuild apps and Facebook, After 37 hours from full charging 7 hour screen on time I have around 28% battery left with Jio and bsnl sims.***Pros -1. Big battery, almost 1 and half day with moderate use.2. Camera is good.3. Notch screen, just beautifulCons -1. So far, I am facing the most ancient disease of samsung on mid range phone ie. Hang issue. Sometimes, it's apps are open automatically.Overall, I have purchased this item because I want a big battery phone and I am glad it is up to the mark.P.S. - the con is have wrote above is maybe I received a faulty product. Hope it May help you guys to make your decision.***Defective product received. The cell phone is hanging up again and again.i recently visited to Samsung Care Center they checked my phone and said that your phone have some sort of manufacturer default.***Friends this is my feeling that more good options are available in this price-1. display durability very poor but quality is great.2. Camera quality is not satisfying specially front camera.3. Low light image quality is very poor.***Firstly the look of the phone is amazing with its amazing notch display it looks attractive.The phone battery is awesome 5000 mAh.Although it has huge battery still its light weight that's great.Having a good hand feeling it feels easy to hold.With its Octa-core processor its faster than any other phones in this range.Back camera is dual camera and is quiet good with 13+5 MP. Good portraits and even good low lightphotos with LED flash, panorama, HDR.Even good vidoes in 1080p @30fps.8MP front camera with 1080p@30fps video recording that's something more amazing.It has display of 6.3 inches, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, and aspect ratio of 19.5:9.This phone is worth buying in this price range available in two variants 3+32 gb and 4+64 gb and alsoin two colours charcoal black and Ocean blue.Finger print sensor and fast face unlock.In this price range being a renowned brand people are gonna run after this that's for sure. Its gonna bea tough fight between other mobiles and this one***"

But my opinion is they are expecting the performance of a iPhone in this mobile(brainless people) . You paid only 5k and expecting 50k experience this is bullshit. Now let me come to the review part. This mobile is good value for money.battery is too good. Performance is decent for a 5k mobile. And the overall performance is good. Camera is not that good. Fingerprint sensor works nicely. Build quality is decent. Speaker is too good. This is my honest review.***Nice but screen***The phone is worth the money. Good performance, the camera quality is average(which doesn't bother me as I don't use it much). The battery life is incredible on a normal use it stands two days. The heating problem written in other comments does not happen while using the phone , except while using it while charging , which is not suitable for any phone's life. The packaging was good and delivered before date. Altogether its worth the money at this price range***Very wrost mobile. From the 1st day itself its not working properly. Not even a proper support from amazon service. Smartcheck app shows that there is no problem in the phone but the performance of the phone is very wrost. Touch is not properly working. Hanging, heating, speakers are not even good. Very very worst mobile. Please don’t buy this***Mobile is too poor quality its getting too heated while on calling n while chargingI want to return it back***"

The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone. Nice colour and Design. 6.5 inch screen makes a great viewing experience for movies and game's specialy PUBG😍😍. Super fast Charging. Full Charge in just 1.5 Hrs. But memory need to be 128 GB for this price range.Camera quality is superb.***Good mobile very nice thank you oppoI am Full happy dis moble camera v v v good super  super***I didnt got free bluetooth speaker and selfie stick what is this***1 Week use Detailed ReviewNo problem on the phone yetPros-Back Camera,Night mode,Slo-Mo,Video, Portrait Mode,etc are excellentFront Camera is perfectThe pop-up design is awesome and eye catchingThe color(Aurora Green) is extremely beautiful and attractiveThe battery life is amazing and VOOC 3.0 Is superbDoes not get heated up even after an extreme useMediatek Helio P70 is perfect and fastOverall A perfect PhoneCons-Plastic BackFront Portrait fades away sometimeInternal memory should have been 128gb at this price segment or there should have been a dedicated slot for memory cardOverall if you can avoid all this cons(I think this Cons wont make a much difference)Oppo F11 Pro is perfect for you Go for Itt***I have been using this phone for last one week and am very satisfied with this deal. Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

Looks great , sounds great. The ""Any key"" call answer feature is great, I can receive call without even looking. There is also auto call recording, number blacklist and vibration features in it too. Call connectivity is good. Call recording and Bluetooth works nicely. I was actually surprised by it's music player performance. Its small speaker is good for calling purpose, although its small speaker can play music but when connected to headphone or Bluetooth speaker it becomes a music player device and did I mentioned its flawless Bluetooth connectivity! .Fm reception is quite impressive. Good battery backup. The only thing I'm missing is a single dedicated key for torch but its old fashioned dedicated keys are also good, we can set any shortcuts to four dedicated keys, Once set now I have to press keys two times to turn torch on/off. It has video player, image viewer and internet (gprs) but as a smartphone user I don't think I will use these features. I did put my SD card in it and transferred downloaded ringtones and mp3 files via Bluetooth from my smartphone as I found its default ringtones were not loud enough. And yes we can set any mp3 files as ringtones too. Now all is good. This little cutie covers all the basic features as default but I like to cook my own food!Thanks PHILIPS and Thanks Amazon.***In the add, it is clearly mentioned that either FM can be listened loud through speaker or through headphones.  But in the  received one doesn't have wireless FM facility. Only you can listen through headphones. My main purpose of the purchase not fulfilled.

There are several things I liked about this mobile primarily its sleek design, good quality call and signal reception. Its very light weight making it easy to carry in pocket. The battery life is also good. Feature wise it has all the features which other brands are offering but this one is at a much lower price than its contemporaries. Overall its one of the best in this price segment.***Very nice basic phone. I bought it for my mom. This phone is very fast and look is very awesome. I liked it very much. very handy, good battery backup, good sound clarity. Charge it once in a week and runs for whole 7 days. It has memory card slot, dual sim slots, radio and torch.***it's easily the best phone in this price.The battery is 1000mah which is quite sufficient for 3 days use.The FM radio also works smoothly.I don't think anyone else offer a better working  double sim phone  at this price range.I am gonna another one for my brother.I got a charger with this phone which is also of very good quality.Totally worth it!!!***Ring tone and speker volume was very bad.you're credited only 949 rupees in my account.another Fifty rupees is loss for me..?The product quality is your problem,not me..This is the last in your app.why you cheat customer..?***"

Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps. For people who used low end phones with slow processors, this honor 8x will feel great.If your budget is 14000/- . there is only one phone in this segment which you should go for. Mi A2 .Mi A2 captures wonderful pictures.Pros:Not listing as you will only see pros everywhere abt this phone. go on to Cons section.Cons:Camera is big let down. there are many options in camera,but picture quality is not good.Speaker sound is not loudThere is slight lag when switching between appsWifi connectivity has issues when switching between 4G/WiFi***Good cell but there are many issue1. No video calling2. No conference call.3. Keyboard are very bad to touch system4. swiftkey internal software and is not good very bad system5. Night mood camera very bad.6. I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone 👌***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality. Within one month the phone dead. I am running to service centre, got replacement. It's working. Appreciate their services***Battery draining very fast. Max it come for 12hrs.I don't recommend to buy this model.***"

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1.

The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

There is touch issue in the four corners of the phone. Camera quality is not great.The box arrived in a sealed pack condition but the seal has sentences with spelling and grammatical mistakes, which creates a doubt if it is an original product. Also, the stickers on the box like - product details, VoLte, manufacturer details are manually and poorly stuck.The protective shield on the phone was improperly stuck, has air bubble below the shield and had fine finger print marks over it. The white box where the sim card ejector tool is fixed had fold marks which could be made out that the tool was removed multiple times from its place.Poor manufacturing quality in India.***Oppo you beauty... Camera quality is superb and battery backup is excellent.***I have purchased this mobile phone a month ago,I am very much impressed with battery and camera quality within this range of mobile phone.I was little warry about oppo as a brand ,but trust me it is worth for money.***This is my comprehensive review about the OPPO A3S, 2 GB ram, 16GB ROM1. Look seems pretty i bought red in color and it look elegant. it seems like premium smartphone.2. when we start the phone it takes minimum time to start. it feels like butter3. initially the processor works good when there are factory applications installed in it.4. Screen touch is bitter less responsive but it is better for this budget.5. Color OS is producing good built up for apps but color response of screen is bitter annoying when use for longtime e.g.  gaming or watching movies6. rear 13+2 MP camera working nicely in day and pretty light condition. in low light photos are somwhat blurry ...but for this budget this camera setup is outstanding, and suffice the purpose. front 8 MP camera is good for daytime selfies and screen flash is also working good.7. Face unlock is very fast and responsive and working well in low light.8, battery is long lasting but takes 3 to 4 hrs for full charge. this is the only con of this that this does not have fast charging mode but again nothing could be better than this phone.9. speaker sound is impressive10, dual sim mode working fine.Now the small glimpse of cons- 1. battery charging time is longer about 3 to 4 hrs for full charge from nil battery.2. OS coloring is not that much good. i think OS upgrade will short out this problem.except everything is outstanding...you can go for this phone without a hassle if your budget is within 9k, No other phone can beat this phone in this budget.***"

The Wifi signal strength is very weak. I can't access Wifi in some parts of the house where all other devices have no problem accessing Wifi.I have seen other users complaining about this on XDA forum.

Will update the review if that happens.***I bought this phone for my grandfather, who was using a Nokia feature phone till now.I wanted a phone with large display (at least 5.5""), good battery life, and simple UI. This phone delivers on all fronts.Battery life is excellent with the 4Ah capacity.RAM is only 1 GB, but that's okay. the user won't be doing that much multitasking :-).Stock Android is simple and easy to learn for first-time users. I think a phone with a custom UI like Xiaomi's MIUI or any Oppo/Vivo phone would be difficult, because of the amount of options and features available.There is a launcher in Play Store made specifically for senior citizen called ""BIG Launcher"". It is a paid app, but you can use the free trial to see if it works for you.Comes with 8.1 Go edition. The Go edition is Android optimized for phones with less RAM. Nokia has a good reputation when it comes to software updates, so I expect this phone to get regular updates and security patches.It has dual front-facing speakers. Once again, good for extra loudness.Nowadays, Android has support for most major Indian languages, so that's also a plus.I also considered the Moto E5 Plus, but decided this was good enough.

You can do nothing with the phone when on call. You cant even check contact list or type a note. Nothing. I didn't find this issue with a colleague who uses this same phone. I was either handed over a defective piece or Nokia is no more the TRUSTWORTHY Nokia.***Very slow and at this price company like Nokia should atleast give 2 to 3gb of RAM.

This is my opinion. Now let us dive into the Pros & Cons of this amazing device, OnePlus 7:Pros:1) Display: I use both Samsung and OnePlus devices. The reason is: I love Samsung's vibrant AMOLED displays and OnePlus device's fantastic, butter-smooth, fastest Oxygen UI. So I always desired both on one phone (display and fastest Oxygen UI). And at last, OnePlus 7 fulfilled my desire. OnePlus 7 has a fantastic UI (Oxygen OS) + display like Samsung devices (like S10+). But note that this will NOT BE BY DEFAULT. By default on this OnePlus 7, the display is not great like Samsung AMOLED displays. To achieve Samsung S10+ display on this OnePlus 7 device, you have to do this: go to Settings --> Display --> Screen Calibration --> Advanced and select AMOLED Wide Gamut. Then see the magic. It matches exactly with Samsung S10+. This option is NOT there on previous OnePlus devices (not there even on 6T). So OP7 gets 5 stars for the display.2) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855 chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. Nothing more to comment. So OP7 gets 5 stars for its powerful processor.3) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. So OP7 too gets 5 stars for its Oxygen UI.4) Camera: I am very much astonished to see the powerful 48 MP camera on this OnePlus 7 device. I have attached a few pictures. Please have a look.5) Battery: Though battery backup will be great on all OnePlus devices, on this particular model I felt battery backup little more powerful compared to older devices. I think this is due to the latest Oxygen version, which has been fine-tuned still more for battery efficiency.6) Storage: Whenever I buy the smartphones, I transfer my huge number of Lord Krishna's bhajans, wallpapers, videos, etc. So since this time I had opted for 256 GB, I was not selective while copying the files. I just copied all my 177 GB data to my new OnePlus 7. And believe it or not, everything just copied by the time I finished my short snacks break. Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage method. So OP7 gets 5 stars for storage too.7) Sound: Except on OnePlus 6, most of the OnePlus users enjoyed the LOUD sound. But on this OnePlus 7 device, along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect, which cannot be revealed in this writing, but only by hearing. So really excellent work they have done on this OnePlus 7 device in speakers segment too. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars in this sound segment too.8) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 6 GB this time also. In addition, we have RAM Boost feature also this time on OnePlus 7 series. So OnePlus 7 gets 5 stars for its fantastic low-power consuming RAM.9) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection. 5 stars.10) Dash Charger: The master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology (excluding Warp charger from the game). 5 stars.11) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth in this new 7 series. Really you love to slide simply. 5 stars.12) Fingerprint sensor: I can say that this is the world's first successful fastest in-display fingerprint scanner. However, I always prefer dedicated hardware fingerprint scanner. Just see OnePlus 6! Even today it is awesome. Anyways. 5 stars.13) Brightness: OnePlus has learned a lesson from its previous failures due to very, very low brightness levels on the screen. Earlier one has to keep brightness level at 80% for normal view. Many customers sold off their devices due to this mistake alone (I have seen in their forums). But fortunately, on this 7 series, the brightness level is good. One has to just keep at 30% to 40% for a good view.14) Vibration Motor: If you all remember, many users suffered from the worst quality vibration motors on a few previous devices, by hearing an abnormal rattling sound. But this time, as they promised, 200% strong we can feel. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity.Cons:This I want to be seen by OnePlus.1) Build Quality: People love even today the classic designs & metal bodies of previous OnePlus devices like 3, 3T, 5, 5T, etc. But this OnePlus 7 looks like plastic back (you can tap and test), although they call a glass body. I don't know what is the use of providing shiny glass bodies when, after all, it doesn't support wireless charging. They should have gone for the metal body, or at least, matte finished glasses like OnePlus 6 Silk White or Matte Black. It doesn't look anymore premium. Forget premium, it doesn't look good at all.2) Color Options: As said above, already the device is too shiny and fingerprint magnet. Along with that, the worst color options we have. I really don't know how many people like the Red color. Though colors are subjective, I don't think at least Red color is for professionals. And only one left option, shiny Mirror Grey. This too not for professionals. Really disappointing by seeing the color options we have. Why not give White & Gold options? OnePlus, it doesn't cost you extra.3) Size, weight, and thickness: I don't know why OnePlus is increasing dimensions, weight, and thickness of the device while Samsung is maintaining all these three in all the segments (budget to premium).Oneplus 5: 7.3 mm & 153 gramsOnePlus 5T: 7.3 mm & 162 gramsOnePlus 6: 7.8 mm & 177 gramsOnePlus 6T: 8.2 mm & 185 grams.And OnePlus 7: 8.2 mm & 182 grams + noticeably a huge ugly camera bump. One may argue that battery capacity is being increased. But just see Samsung. Let us consider even S10+. It is just 7.8 mm and 175 grams with 4000 mAH battery (whereas OP's max. is 3700 mAH battery). I am NOT satisfied with this.I think OnePlus should implement Samsung's wonderful thought of introducing small (S10e), medium (S10) & big (S10+) when they have started entering in series mode. But this device is bigger and heavier than S10+. If you are size-minded or too much worried about bulkiness, this is not for you (forget about OnePlus 7 Pro...my god, 8.8 mm with 205 grams).4) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: Today almost all the companies have started to provide pop-up cameras even for budget phones and the biggest advantage of this is - full-screen display. Whereas this is NOT THERE on this OnePlus 7. Very sad. They could have charged little more for this and provided Pop-up Selfie Camera (just like in 7 Pro). I really think this is a big con in today's technology.5) Screen Guard: I saw a few people complaining protective film on OnePlus 7 Pro had bubbles and not applied properly. I think this is the case on this OnePlus 7 too. Because on my device also (although flat surface) have two air bubbles on the protective film. First time I am seeing this on OnePlus.VERDICT:Although OnePlus 7 has a few Cons, while considering the PROS and PRICE, IT IS VERY MUCH WORTH BUYING and really deserves 5 stars. Though OnePlus 7 Pro disappointed many, I am sure this will NOT disappoint, because it is really worth FOR THE PRICE WHAT YOU PAY. So definitely this device has saved OnePlus I feel.***Amazing Smart Phone to have.Pros:1.Smooth Display2.Super Fast Dash Charging3.Swift response4.Great Camera and Video Quality5. Affordable as compared to Pro Version6. Amoled Full HD7.Snapdragon 855 SoC***It is so buttery smooth and insanely fast that i don't have words to describe whole experience... Just buy it you won't regret... Its better than OnePlus 7 Pro.***it is getting heated and screen is blinking non stop***Phone stopped working after 2 days. Not switching on. Please don't buy. Also not able to return.***Oneplus, as always packs the pure raw power in their devices. Its slick, fast, smooth and much improved entertainment box now. It has stereo speakers but sadly no aux, along with that the saddest part is, there is no type c to aux dongle. Deducted two stars because of same charging speed as last year and aux missing.****Honest Review*Bought Oneplus 7 in the first sale.Delivered 2 days backUsing OnePlus for the first time. It is  just superb.Not easy to describe OnePlus 7 in a small review.Camera is fantastic.This is the first phone which is faster then the speed of my fingers :p33,000 is a handsome amount but i think this phone is value for money.If you are one who spend his good time using phone then this is best for you. Its processor saves time because now i am able to do work even more faster.Features you can easily check in product description.5/5 for camera.5/5 for processor.5/5 for shape.5/5 overall.***Well, much awaited OnePlus really stood up the wait we all did.I won't go for the pros and cons! I will go with the feel this phone has which it's competitors such as Asus, Redmi, etc doesn't at all.Yes, there are some quirks but still this is valuable smartphone your hard earned money can really buy.Your money will be on the right side with this OnePlus 7, if you're in doubt which phone to buy in 35k budget.. go with this one hands down, eyes closed. This will you that premium feel.Clean crisp display, loud stereo speakers, super fast phone, nicer camera, fastest storage, etc.Pro tip: Install GCam for OnePlus 7 and click pictures as good as pixel phones. Trust me. You'll love your OnePlus more for this. It will significantly improve your phone's camera quality at par with flagships costing 60k.***"

Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after ""is"" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone 👌***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality.

Mobile network signal reception is very weak and says service unavailable.2. Slow charging3. Overheating4. Internet speed too slow5. Display width is too small( Feels like 5"" display)6. Cameras don't have clarity7. 4g signal is weak8. Mentioned made in India but says frequently used apps as alipay, qq, etc., which are Chinese apps9. Tried to get replacement using smartchk app but it responds like a Chinese electronic voting machine(Votes for Redmi:Says mobile works well)10. So no replacements if mobile has quality issues!!!!Worth only half the price .ie. ₹6500/- only, since we have to get adjusted to low quality...***I got this product and face below issue in 4 days.1) Couple of times the Phone gives a ECHO to the Listener on the other end and couple of time to me also.2) The charger get hot when you keep it on charging.Other issues.1) I was using Asus Zenphone2 of 2015 Model with same ram and Internal Memory,but this phone is really very slow in loading web pages an even your tube.2) The network keeps on fluctuating.Badluck:I got in the trap of Amazon Policy saying that we cannot get refund , we can only give replacement. I would request all the user to kindly be careful when you are buying the product. Amazon very smartly mention at only one place that you can get only replacement and not refund.So the user has not other option left just to get the product replace.Conclusion for me.I can only pray that the product work atleast for 1 year and the replace product doesn't have the technical issue and i dont have to run behind the service center.I will definitely AVOID buying products from Amazon. Save  my money as I was planning to go for Prime membership.***Display quality is top notch, overall the quality of the phone is very good. All metal body. Camera is good too. Touch smoothness is amazing. I will definitely recommend to buy this phone.The USB is not type C, it is the old one. This is the only con that i found till now. It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use.. Thank Amazon for quick delivery. Thanks Redmi for worthy mobile in such a attractive price..***"

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone.

Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

Bought it looking at the triple camera but it seems it is for display only. The camera is worst and takes you back to the phones 10 year old. No image stabilization, no clarity, no zoom. Camera is essential part of phones today and this phone is a waste with such a bad camera. I faced some issues with keyboard and typing as well. While typing it takes you back to home screen, may be some bugs.Weight is also on higher side.Phone is quite thick as well so no comparision with other premium modelsBest quality is battery life which can last upto 2 days with heavy usage.

Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after ""is"" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***"

There have already been multiple instances of exploding of Samsung phone in the past and overheated battery raises a concern.On top of everything, comes the service of Amazon. So much for the 10-day replacement policy in case of any issue. I have been contacting Amazon for more than 10 days about the issue and they have not been able to identify the issue. Their app is not available in the jurisdiction (sent a screenshot to them and there was no response). A technician visit is scheduled for after 5 days a technician visits and he has not been able to replicate the issue because he didn't have the time for a 30 min call which is when the phone gets heated up. Now it is the responsibility of the customer to install a temperature app, monitor the temperature and the raise the issue only if the temperature rises above 45 degrees Celcius. They seriously hope the user to hold a device at 45 degrees. They should revoke the policy of replacement if they don't want to support the claims of the customer. This will at the very least vanish any false hope that the customer would have while buying the product.***useless phone, don’t buy this display camera is very bad 5k redmi phones are 1000 times better than this phone***PRODUCT IS OK***This is  a good phone than m20 because it has that amoled screen..

Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***"

What I liked is good battery with fast charging, nice front camera for video call, rear camera is fine, included back cover and screen protector in box also earphones means not required to purchase extra things, android go means will be providing update for 2 years... Speaker also good, one more thing which I like is gestures like double tap wake up and when screen is off and you make 'V' its flash is lit...Only the main negative point is ram is 1gb that doesn't allow to run two apps simultaneously... I also would have preferred 2gb variant but when I purchased, its 2gb variant was not released in market...Overall well and good...Today when the representative took feedback on call and asked about rating, I told that will give 4 stars for which he didn't convinced for more and only replied to write a review...

It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category.Pros:Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM .Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to)Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones.Sound is good -clear and audible.Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though.Sturdy phone for long durability.Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale.Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera. (Don't expect much from basic phone, because it is to simplify needs).***Best basic mobile with front camera and front flash, and good battery life in this price, and mobile is easy to use, but I feel sound is low compared to other mobiles..***It’s a gift for my mom, as she is not tech savvy and is not into smart phones. This phone is perfect for normal use and is very light and cute one!***Very good phone with very good quality Loudspeaker & mic & earpiece quality with strong standard from Nokia!Buy it!***The sound quality is bad to say the least.  When I called Nokia Customer care they promised to replace the piece and assured of pick up in 24-48 hours.  gave me a complaint no. I have also sent a mail to their customer care.  Its been 5 days and no pick up arranged. I got this phone for my aged mother who is comfortable to use a feature phone.  The purpose is lost when you cant hear the conversation.Will Amazon/seller help me with replacement.  This is still in warranty period***This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it.Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments.Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied.Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons)Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders.Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan.Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.***No metal parts.. feels a very cheep phone... Screen was not that much good.***Sound quality is best.Image quality is best as far as this small handset is considered.Thw only one thing i disliked is that nokia changed the keypad locking style (in old models it was press OK and then *. Now it is totally confusing to lock keypad. Battery backup would have been little more, still it last lasts for 2 days with Avg. Calling and playing music files***"

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.***Do not Compare it with Poco F1, Nokia 8.1 shines in its own way.  Buy this, only if have following requirements1) High-quality camera with excellent low light performance2) Premium Design3) Stock Android.4) Good Responsiveness.5) occasional gaming.6) Good Battery backup of nearly 2days on normal use.***After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.***1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.***Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D***"

But when I saw the charger it said ""made in china"". Still OK. Now I thought of charging the phone a bit.. just 5 minutes after setting the new phone. As soon as I connected the charger to the socket, there was a spark and shot circuit in the charger, phone was not connected. So go disappointed. I am not returning this phone as I have already gifted it. Not sure if Amazon seller would be able to send replacement for the charger alone. Amazon never replaced the product even after multiple conversations..***The phone at first look is an ice breaker at this price ...during the first year everything related to it I'm pressed me weather it is sound quality or features.....but as the first year ended the story took a horrible turn. My phone has now a lot of issues , it's charging speed has slowed down, it didn't charge at once,I have to reinsert the charging pin while charging as it stops charging after some times, it comes out of sleep after pressing the side button a lot of times,and even when I press the side key to lock it ,it makes an emergency number call automatically......etc....etc....And now it has revealed it's face after 1yr so I can't avail for warranty replacement.***Amazing Smartphone under 10k, Camera is mind blowing.Everything are working well.No Issues 👍👌***Highly NOT RECOMMENDEDWhile ordering I was like I'm ordering Indian make handset with patriotic feeling and expected the unexpected :(Pathetic phone, received defected peice, got it exchanged after so much hassle, again received faulty handset. If someone calls me other person can't hear me properly. They think I've put the on speaker and speaking from other room with phone in other room. So awful.***Whatever this phone might have been capable of has been completely ruined by the software on this phone and despite almost everybody calling it out to micromax, there is no hint of any improvement regarding the same.After almost an year using this phone, I would not recommend this or any other micromax phone for that matter. To what extent do we settle with this company for the sake of patriotism, atleast the Chinese are working hard and competing with apple, and here is micromax only interested in churning in money by reselling the fruit of Chinese hardwork. Great example of pathetic leadership and certainly not a company that shows any patriotism or deserves the patriotic support shown by Indians towards this company !***This is a really worst phone .This phone is arise ao many software problems .Like hanging,slow working apps..Touch will be loose with in a short period of time ..And lack of servicing centers ...Even small crash on phone also this phone unworthy for warranty ... Software update kavalante 300/-.at services centre.,such a big mistake in my daily usage..So plz beware of this phone***Better than Redmi Note 4... Using this phone since last 6 months..no problem at all.. Everything is good in this phone under the price range 10k... A better try from Micromax to get back into the market...***Got this phone delivered on 15th aug, using it for more than 15 hours now. Facing problem with battery drainage, it reduces like 20% with normal usage in less than an hour. By normal usage I mean even updating the contact details as it is new phone. Also when the phone is not in use i.e on standby it reduces 5-7% in an hours time.So 20% drainage in 1hr is really bad. Hence applying for Return.***"

So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

It has got 2 nano sim slots and a dedicated memory card slot (2+1).Other than the phone, amazon delivery service is a bit let down. It took 6 days to deliver the item from Calcutta to Assam. Whereas last year i bought 2 Redmi Note 4 ( for me and my uncle) from flipkart and mi india website, if you recall, Mi had flash sale every Friday. Hence i bought both handset on different dates. To my surprise i placed the order on Friday and received the item on Sunday on one occasion and Monday on the other occasion, which the shipped through ekart and FedEx respectively. Merely in 2-3 i got my phone. But Amazon's courier service is a total letdown as compared ekart and FedEx.***""Phone's Temperature"" if talk or surfacing internet, phone will be hotter.....Hanging continuously...Have a point on the screen..... If we talk much more time u could be tempted because of phone radiation... Etc...  This phone is not good like Redmi 5pro***The Red color looks tacky. Guess I should have bought black instead. The phone feels somewhat cheap in red to be honest. I understand Xiaomi did not supply headphone with this phone. I also feel they should have not supplied with the cheap *** and flimsy phone case (Its an insult lol).  Why even send it. Its very generous of Xiaomi India !! Thank you so much (If I will spend Rs.600 on a head phone then surely I can spend another 200 on a half decent phone case).The screen is awesome!! So is the battery! User interface is not confusing unlike other brands but I will miss Google Now Launcher which gives lesser mortals feel of stock android (Google stopped providing for newer Android OS). Camera is good.This is my 1st Xiaomi phone and I am somewhat happy (damn you red color) with it. And maybe I had higher expectations on the back panel.***Awesome mobile. I recently switched from MotoG3 to Note 6 PRO. Its really a different experience. Using for last 24hrs and still my battery is 70% left with medium usage of 4G. Worth to buy and use..

Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick Guide","I love this phone thank you amazon and Oppo team for F11 pro.I have one issue with phone :My phone is getting heated while calling (for more than 15-20 min. talk) please suggest me and if any one facing this same issue so please reply...***First of all thanks to OPPO for making this wonderful device. The design at its best and better than Vivo V15 pro. I checked V15 pro at the stores and for some reason I didn't like it, may be the build quality looked too plasticky and saturated display. So waited for F11 pro and its worth a wait. Let me list out all the pros and cons after 1 week of usage.Pros:1. Build Quality: This first thing we witness in a phone is the build. Trust me, oppo has cut corners but have made sure it has that premium feel. Though the back is polycarbonate plastic, with some process they have made it look like a glass panel. Little slippery but easy and comfortable to hold. Phone has got some weight because of that huge battery, but because of the weight it gives us a metal glass feeling when we hold. All the keys are in good position and again no plastic feel at all.2. Display: I hate notch and all those tear drop or water drop things. F11 pro with the panoramic screen is an absolute treat to watch. Its just fantastic and mesmerizing whenever we hold and touch it, a butter smooth experience. Screen is bright enough even in outdoor conditions and very colorful. If you like bigger display this is the phone. Again this is better than V15 pro.3. Camera: In an oppo shared article I read the sensor used in oppo f11 pro is the same Sony sensor IMX586 which they used in Redmi Note 7 pro. Looks like the news is for real. Camera quality from rear and front is top notch. Natural colors, Outstanding details, Perfect HDR shots and a easy friendly camera UI. The pop-up camera technology is too good to see. Its fast and works quietly.4. Battery: No problems with the battery, it comes more than a day. No drain at all.5.Charging: When f11 pro was released there was a con which was discussed widespread is about the micro USB port and not Type C. Now I'm going to add this in the pros here. Because the VOOC technology is just awesome.Its just super fast charging. When I received the phone it was around 20% battery, when I charged using VOOC within less than 30 mins it was full charged. When you switch off and charge its even more faster.6. Performance: We have seen this P70 chipset in many phones earlier. One of the fastest and it performs well here too. No lags at all during normal usage and also it can handle any game you throw at it. Have no complaints at all on performance. Oppo has designed it perfectly7. Sound: Sound quality from the bottom speaker is above average. But that doesn't mean its bad. Its perfect sound quality, good form media activities and games too. Earpiece receiver is very loud and too crisp and clear. Cellular call quality at its best.8. Network: WiFi and data connectivity works perfectly without any drop and the reception performance is top notch.9. Face lock is super fast and finger print is faster as well10. Color OS 6 on F11 pro and I kind of like it. They have improved lot of things and many features added as well. Stock UI lovers better stay away from this phone. But trust me Color OS works like a charm. Already got two security updates. No complaints at all.Cons:1.Phone is premium no doubt about it and super fast performance. Its a must buy phone and I will suggest this over Vivo V15 pro. But with the P70 processor this should be between the price range 20k to 21k.2.The storage limit it should be 128GB for a 6GB RAM and not 64GB. Also this is a hybrid slot where there is no place for SD card when we use two sims. Oppo should have considered three slots when they have decided to go for a 64GB storage limit.Just those two cons, but again this is a beast and a must buy. Like I said its little expensive but in online markets you have this exchange offers and bank discounts where we can bring the price down. So go for it guys, you won't regret.***Terrific purchase.. got heavy exchange value for my old phone.Pros- Superb camera, night light camera is amazing...- Vooc charging (10% to 100% charging in just 30 mins.- iPhone type headset.- Full view display- Andriod pie featuresNo cons till now..***Very Nice Phone. Nice colour and Design. 6.5 inch screen makes a great viewing experience for movies and game's specialy PUBG😍😍. Super fast Charging. Full Charge in just 1.5 Hrs. But memory need to be 128 GB for this price range.Camera quality is superb.***Good mobile very nice thank you oppoI am Full happy dis moble camera v v v good super  super***I didnt got free bluetooth speaker and selfie stick what is this***1 Week use Detailed ReviewNo problem on the phone yetPros-Back Camera,Night mode,Slo-Mo,Video, Portrait Mode,etc are excellentFront Camera is perfectThe pop-up design is awesome and eye catchingThe color(Aurora Green) is extremely beautiful and attractiveThe battery life is amazing and VOOC 3.0 Is superbDoes not get heated up even after an extreme useMediatek Helio P70 is perfect and fastOverall A perfect PhoneCons-Plastic BackFront Portrait fades away sometimeInternal memory should have been 128gb at this price segment or there should have been a dedicated slot for memory cardOverall if you can avoid all this cons(I think this Cons wont make a much difference)Oppo F11 Pro is perfect for you Go for Itt***I have been using this phone for last one week and am very satisfied with this deal. Earlier I felt of going for Redmi Note 7 pro as it was a amazingly low price. But then read some reviews and feedback and changed my mind. So, although this is pricier here are some extra things you get for that money:1.) Very fast charging VOOC technology and included charger of 20W. It takes not more than an hour to go from 9 to 100% battery.2.) The battery is very efficiently managed that I almost am left with 50% battery by the end of the day. So for reasonable usage battery can very comfortably last two days. But if you have heavy usage like long hours of video watching, video games u think battery will serve decently for a day. And if you have even heavier usage, just leave your phone with your VOOC charger for an hour and you are again full.3.) The rising camera is just amazing. Face detection is really amazing even in very low lights. Interestingly I tried with my photo clicked in anither tab, and face detection failed. Means the face detection has decent level of protection.4.) Screen is very bright and wide panoramic display looks great.5.) 48MP rear camera delivers great pictures. And it doesn't take much time. Someone was qouting Redmi note 7 that when we have to take 48MP pictures phone takes almost 10seconds to save image. No such thing happen here. It's just click fast.The quality of selfies in low and bright light are amazing. Portrait mode also words great. Edge detection is really amazing. I am attaching an interesting image which has been taken with rear camera where sun is directly in front of camera. Usually any camera blow in such situations. But see how beautifully Opportunity f11 pro have managed to do the task. I was really impressed.5.) You don't have to see advertisements ;) as in Redmi note 7 pro. I was really surprised to see that we have to see advertisements in Redmi note 7 pro. It is as if we are just hiring device from Redmi. :(6.) Overall performance is also good.7.) Overall quality of material, cover, data cable, headphones provided is great. If you consider all above the cost almost justify itself.However below are some cons I found but still I recommend this device considering above pros:1.) Only 64 GB storage option and not 128GB. Opportunity should either have offered 128GB or a dedicated memory slot. Unfortunately  none is offered. But anyway, you can easily buy any OTG pendrive and can transfer your data quickly when it gets beyond available space.2.) I earlier had 10.or G, the good thing there was the way they had put binaural effect in phone speakers. They had used bottom speaker for right audio and earpiece for left audio and that used to give good listening experience without even headphones. Although, OPPO f11 pro cones with dedicated headphones.***"

After a discussion with my friend, I checked V11 Pro over POCO F1 as I'm an ardent Xiaomi Fan. The specs were amazing except the processor. However V11 pro handles the apps like a charm. I play Asphalt 9 often and the performance is always great.  Camera is decent. It makes me look too white and you never get the natural look. Selfie lovers are taken care of with several features and 25MP front camera.Low light capabilities are worst and the processing algorithm works worst  under few conditions. When digital zoomed, it smudge the faces and it was too worst in back lit conditions. HDR works decent.  Phone feels very light in hand and moving from 5.5 inch display to this I didn't have any issues. I love this display, however the display is on the warmer side and I had to change it in settings and I still feel it is warmer.  Regarding the software, the Funtouch OS is overdone and the updates are very rare. I am not sure about the update support in the future and update to Android 9. Few issues like, when you switch on wifi in the control centre,it goes to the WIFI settings everytime, the same applies to bluetooth. It is irritating when using other apps. Multitasking works only with very few apps.  Dedicated Game mode is amazing. Search feature in the settings is not there which is disappointing.  The only downside of the mobile is the Operating System.  Quick charge is amazing and it charges the 3400mAh battery in around 90 to 100 minutes. It easily stands for a day with moderate usage. Heavy usage may take you around 8 to 9 hours to dry the battery.  Amazing piece of hardware with Super AMOLED display which looks great and the display is almost bezel-less.The graphics around the fingerprint scanner is amazing.Face ID works better and in display fingerprint scanner is sometimes a hit or miss. I rely much on the Face ID which works even in darker conditions.  Package has an earphone which is a nice touch comparing other brands who don't care about that.  I would definitely recommend this mobile.Hits :  Amazing Display  Face ID  PerformanceMiss:  Terrible Operating System  Fingerprint scannerI would recommend this phone for the price especially for the display.***I never liked Vivo or Oppo. I was always a fan of Xiomi. Vivo V11 Pro was not my first choice. I wanted to buy Real Me 2 Pro. With all offers this phone was around 18K same price as 8GB, 128 GB model of Real me Pro. I just hated the flash sales.My requirement was  Good Screen, Nice Photos, Music and I do not care much about playing games.My experiences after using 10 daysPros:-1.Superb display it is a treat to watch the screen. Nearly Bezel Less and the water drop notch you would hardly notice while watching videos.2.Camera Performance is good, but in an effort to make me look white it over smudges in portrait shots other wise camera performance is decent on Front and Back3.Super light weight, slips from hand easily.4. I do not play games for me battery lasts almost whole day, but the charge is super fast, almost 1 to 2 percentage for every minute. So even I am in low battery, it charges in no time.5. Face unlock is super fast even at night and in dark. You will never use finger print scanner.Cons:-1. I always used stock android or MIUI. Funtouch OS is a mess, but since we do not do any setting changes regularly, it is ok.2. Updates are hopeless, this is October, but still phone runs on August Security Patch. I would recommend this phone only if you are getting it for around 18K or less else it is not worth it.***Worst part about the phone1. Funtouch version of Android- compulsory u have to use funtouch. U can. Not  switch to pure Android launcher- u can not arrange the apps alphabetically.- the easy access button has limited use- basic pull down quick access not availableDon't buy if u have been using this phone***Purchased with Good Hopes, But..1.Screen lock is not working, If you keep Finger for 4-5 second Screen will unlock By Luck2. Call Drop is Common Problem, Anytime during call Call Sensor stopped working.3.Face Unlock is Difficult to Open, Always you have to Draw pattern For Unlocking Device5.Phone Starts Hanging6.Picture Quality is So So, You cant compare this Device with One Plus any series. Previously i was Oneplus3 user. I am feeling Bad ,why i decided to purchase this by exchanging my Op36. ""Battery"" Dash Charging Is Only the Tag line to Sell device. It will take around 1.50-2.30 hour to charge device.7.Phone Heating is Normal Problem.8.Screen and Back Cover Catch dirt and finger prints. You have to keep one Tissue always for wiping the Dirt.9.Sound Quality is Good, Video Quality is Good10.Call voice is Ok Ok.. Not so Clear, Background Noice Is more disturbing.""Purchase this Device at Your Own Risk""Because Resell Value is Tooo Low.***Picture quality as u can see awesome!!!!***Unboxed found new handset, started phone and its getting hang, restarting, not starting , really upset . Can’t use the phone . First time shifted to android and was really upset to see a new phone having problem. Requested for replacement/ refund . Amazon mentioned technician will rectify issue and let me know till than I have to wait. Better to buy offline use. Waste of moneyI brought this phone after all positive reviews here and sad that I am giving one star because of its poor performance/ actually no performing all***I WAS USING I PHONES FROM LAST 7 YEARS. I WAS NOT AT ALL ATTRACTED IN ANY ANDROID PHONE IN LAST 7 YEARS, BUT AFTER 7 YEARS I HAVE DECIDED TO GO FOR ANDROID AGAIN. AND MARK MY WORDS THIS VIVO V11 PRO IS AMAZING, SUPERB, MIND BLOWING CELL PHONE.

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

Where is Quality control. Am I paying for trash for new items. Why are you encouraging such sellers. Pass a rule to sellers to pay double amount the customer paid if product is defect. Is it a game, why any phone will not work Loud Speaker if It is New item.I wasted my time ordering phone.I am very disappointed.***I have read many reviews over here and other e-shopping portals. Over all doubt was regarding display of number and other settings.My requirement was only CLI. It displays number cleanly. Fonts are clearly visible and readable from any corner. It has all basic setting available like setting date time and ringtones etc. After all it's not smartphone so I don't expect much either.I am very much happy with voice clarity and quality. 5 out of 5 for the same. Numeric pad is soft. User friendly.***Phone is good  but the supplier should thoroughly inspect the phone before deliver to the customer. The supplier answered me that pls contact beetel customer support for any problem and he did mentuon he us a reseller. If you cant provide support for very immediate problem do not supply the product***The sound quality is pathetic, we need to put the handset pressed against ears and we cant hear even if we switch on the fan in the room, the other party cant hear if phone is used as speaker phone.Please dont buy this even if given at through away price.***Crappy product delivered and just requested a return. Lots of things wrong with the instrument I got. But most annoying things were1. Pressing the receiver knob does not cut the call or dial tone and I can only make one call ever. I would need to disconnect and reconnect the wire to make another call.2. Speaker functionality was inconsistent. Sometimes it would turn up and sometimes it would not.Overall, not quality checked before it was sent. Amazon does not seem to care about the quality of the products people order. Waste of time for me. I could have easily bought it in a physical store instead of relying on the crappy stuff these guys deliver.***Overall a decent product and gives value for money. The display is bit tricky since its not visible at all angles.  Have to be viewed at a particular angle to see the numbers clearly even when back-lit. Have decent enough features.  Speaker clarity is also good. One thing is that once you replace the batteries all the stores numbers in speed dial will be erased.  You have to feed it in again.***Exactly a month after the purchase, the phone stops ringing. Though the speaker functions as it should be, the buzzer stopped working and now we are left with a phone that doesnot give a ring for an incoming call.So my advice to prospective buyers is , avoid these kinds of fancy ones and better stick to the traditional models.***Good phone for taking conf calls on speaker which is why I bought this phone.***"

Phone finish and looks are average.***I chose Nokia over others for simple UI, its durability, quality and battery backup based on  performance of my old Nokia basic phones which even today are functioning without any flaws. But since Nokia has handed over its  handset production  to HMD global the quality of Nokia products especially feature phones have declined. This product Nokia 150 disappoints in every aspect like battery backup (3-4 days max in standby and 2 days if you do some calling and  play music ),camera quality(even  jiophone has better quality ,Nokia 150 will capture ghost out of you) and every thing for which i purchased it. At same or cheaper price other companies are offering better features like inbuilt call recorder , 3000mah battery with power bank feature. what is use of durability when performance is poor. I do not recommend it for basic phone user. Go for Samsung if you are using 2G network or better go for jiophone (which i have tried and tested).Regarding the  seller i.e Appario retail, they didn't mention any of the two IMEI Numbers without  which warranty can't be claimed instead they have mentioned  one IMEI number in 'order summary' where it has been clearly written that it can not be presented as an invoice. Such carelessness from highly rated seller. Soon will contact Amazon cust. Care. For that and for future purchases of mobile handsets, i will make sure before buying that seller mentions atleast one IMEI no. In tax invoice or serial no. in cade of other electronic items.Thanks.***This was classified as a Sr. Citizen mobile and I purchased it for an elderly person. While the mobile is good, simple operation, etc. IT CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS A SENIOR CITIZEN MOBILE - THE KEYS ARE TOO SMALL, SCREEN FONT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER, THERE IS NO SINGLE TOUCH DIALING AND NO DISTRESS CALL BUTTON. DISAPPOINTED SINCE THIS IS BEING TOUTED AS A SR. CITIZEN MOBILE BY ALL.***this is an excellent basic phone. I bought it for my mother. Using the phone is quiet easy. battery back up is excellent overall phone can be recommend for new purchase***I'm fully satisfied with my new Nokia 150 . It withstand my all the expectation. But don't expect a lot from it as Nokia can't give a lot of features in this price it. It's rings for few seconds and then the call gets rejected. camera is of standard quality .These were the only drawbacks of this phone, otherwise the phone is fabulous and gives that nostalgic feeling like other Nokia phones give.***I am using small phone besides my smartphone.

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone 👌***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality.

Amazon won't allow return until technician looks at the phone???  Oneplus support said take it to a service center but couldn't tell me the closest one.

I'm sure they will now try to push a replacement but I'm not really interested in the product anymore.***One plus 6 was costing 28k during the big billion sale and 6T costs  38k. It is not worth to spend 10 k just for some small improvements.***OnePlus 6T turned out to be an utter disappointment for me. I received a faulty device and when tried getting support from OnePlus I received disappointment only. Even after 6 calls, several mails and a visit to the service centre I got no solution as such. The cherry on top of all this was lie by the people at service centre. He couldn't connect my device to the laptop for software update and told me he updated the device. I could see that my email id was still there. How's it even possible if the software was updated after hard reset?My device has battery drain and heating issues along with apps crashing.It's not just OnePlus but Amazon too didn't help me either. They couldn't even connect a call to the technical support department.I feel cheated and betrayed by both OnePlus and Amazon.***Good build.amazing battery life.

Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps.

I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala***I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.***Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few***Nice Phone in the segment of Budget Phone. Superb Look. with Type C Fast Charger and Type C earphone in the box. Running Smooth.***Plz avoid buying ....1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...***1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3. For me non existence of 3.5 mm headphone jack is just not a big deal***Worst camera and ear piece is really horrible.. There is no Samsung pay also.. Honestly the worst phone to buy***"

The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.***its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering ""mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money"". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.***After using this phone for 3 months.Pros:Battery is awesome. I charge it only once a day (2 hrs fully charged) and use it voraciously.Finger print sensor is better than Apple and Samsung.Download apps and play games. (Even PUBG) almost 100 apps work fine at the same time. (I have around 87 now)Network, wifi, Bluetooth, mi file transfer all works well and extremely fast.HD quality videos.MI videos provides you option for subtitles as well, no need for any other video app.Cons:Image quality can't match iPhones.A few applications crashes but you can report it to get it fixed.Mi Cloud storage is as usual 5GB as given by almost all phones.3 months and no any issues as such to not recommend this phone. I bought it for 8999.***Excellent phone in this price***Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenlyturned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what  a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .***Battery backup is too goodyou can play hd games free of lags like Pubg,pubg works great on this device.sound is decentcamera is average not bad nor too good.overall at this price range i must say this phone is the best.Bootup process is also quick not much time needed to boot.this phone doesnt hang unlike other phones..***It's very good gift for my son. He is a great happy with gift given by me. Thank you Amazon.***Actually I have used 3 phone of MI1) redmi 22) redmi 2 prime3) redmi 3S Prime.*Poor build quality*Poor performance of camera even in low light*Poor response from manufactureDue to absence of service centre at Ranchi,I did send redmi 2 prime by home pick up service of MI at Gujarat.I did send my phone two time there but problem remain there in phone.3rd time when again I sent it, they rejected to service it and told me that I had repaired phone at local shop while I did not do that.I wrote to India has of MI Mr Jain at Twitter, I wrote to company headquarter via mail but no response. I wrote 3 time , then also I didn't get any response.Redmi 3s, I had to wait for almost 1 month to change screen.When there was poor network of JIO , I used redmi 3s prime, even most of my friends had either redmi 3s or 3s prime.

Only problem is while adding picture contacts it does not take from contct book and we have to add the names manually.The torch is very dim. For senior citizens they need a more powerful torch as their eyesight will be poorer than us.There should be an android version also because then videos can be played very effectively and the old members can have contact with their dear ones through whatsapp and other such apps.The dock charging facility is very convenient for old people who may not be able to connect the charging cable correctly.***Purchased for my mom. Earlier used Aasan (i ball) for 4 years.This item not compatible with Hearing Aid as claimed. Screen lock gets fixed & battery has to be removed to unlock. Hands free speaker sounds not good. Plastic uses is not of good quality. Often fails to ring. Camera is useless.I wanted to return it but return window closed now. Only good thing is cradle charging. Aasan-2 was much better. Overall poor Chinese stuff.***so i got this phone for my Grandma.. the phone seemed to be feature packed and apt for a senior citizen. HOWEVER, it has just barely been a week and the display has gone blank! Even when the display was on it was flickering.. and today i saw some more reviews highlighting the same problem.. Moreover, the product offers only a replacement and not a refund (unless you call amazon customer service). Something to bear in mind if you are thinking of buying this garbage..I would not recommend this product to anyone..P.S.: ""Three Cheers"" to the amazon customer service who understood the issue and offered a full refund though the return policy only mentioned replacements.***Purchased for my elder parent. Very loud quality at the time of ringing can listen to other rooms also. Very easy to operate and the keys are the bigger one. Recommended for Sr. citizens or who wants a basic phone with good quality.***this is a very good phone. I had bought their earlier model a few years ago for my mother and now this one as a replacement for that phone. These phones are custom designed for use by old people and suits my mother who is 82 years old. Simple to use with large buttons and a large font display , they are the best in market for senior citizensgood loud sound, big buttons, large font in display, charging cradle, a large handset so it is easy to hold for old people, these are some of the sensible features of this phone***No doubt, the product is good. But not functioning at present. I kept inside my side pant pocket, suddenly rain started, I ran and stood under the selter, when I reached my home and kept on the table and found all the key board lights are blinking including the torch also. I have tried to off the phone but could not. I had an impressions that may be due to moisturization and opened back side of the phone separated the battery and kept the phone under sun light for some times and tried after some times but not functioning. It seems that phone is to be repaired. Since the phone is under warranty, requesting your intervention to short out the said discrepancy at earliest please. Please do the needful and oblige. Best Regards, Sandipan Sarkar.***Worst product for seniors.. they cheated me with price first but Amazon fixed it for me. I had ordered it for my father and he been complaining display isn't good so I thought he ain't used to it.. now that I'm home and I see the screen is weird and sometimes even becomes totally white and have to restart to fix it.

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

No Ads. No Pre-information. Fearing S10 sales? Or hurryingly released to beat Redmi Note 7? Anyways. Let us see the pros & cons:Pros:1) Display: The best display in the market till date. It is a known fact (through internet sources) that Samsung manufactures display for iPhones, the world's costliest phones. So as usual, they stand superb in this Super AMOLED display with Full HD+.2) Backup Beast: 4000 mAH battery will last: 3 days for light users; 2 days for moderate users; 1 day for heavy users.3) Full Screen: Display is almost full. Just a small and perfectly placed camera in the middle - U Notch. I felt this is far better than abnormal camera placements in S10 series.4) Fantastic Camera: In the light, whether the rear camera or front camera, both are excellent while producing 25 MP pics. See the sample shots at 3rd and 4th images of Lord Krishna.5) Great Design: As usually, A series from Samsung always look very premium. And this too looks premium.6) Screen Protection: After searching over the net, though this doesn't have Gorilla Glass, it does have Asahi's Dragon Trail glass, which is also rugged when comes to protection.7) Charging: First time Samsung has provided C-Type charger, that too with a very faster charger (15W). I meant at this price point.8) UI: Samsung's new One Touch UI is great. Very nice to customize.9) Price: Dead cheap. Samsung has decided to be very aggressive in the market. At this price, one can blindly go for this.Cons:1) Camera: In low lighting conditions, the cameras' quality is not very good.2) Plastic Back: I think Samsung should have provided a glass-back or metal-back at this price point. They have provided a plastic back (polycarbonate).3) Processor: Nowadays, for this price range, a high-end processor is expected. But Samsung never does this. Because it invests its money in the display. So this con is subjective. For display lovers, this is not a big con. But for speed lovers, this will be a big con.4) Speaker: This is the biggest con in all the mobiles I have found. I don't know why. It is ONE & ONLY ONEPLUS, which provides users very high quality and loudest speakers in the industry; that too in a single speaker. I really don't know why companies don't learn from OnePlus.5) Ineffective Fingerprint Sensor: I don't know why companies are trying to put fingerprint sensors inside the display. The outside hardware fingerprint sensor is FAR FAR BETTER THAN IN-DISPLAY FINGERPRINT SENSOR (even in look-wise). Even OnePlus 6T, which has such a high-end processor, fail to recognize and unlock quickly our fingerprints. So why did Samsung tried this?6) Double Tap: Samsung should learn to provide ""Double Tap"" to turn off/on screen. We should rely only on the power button. Though this is not a big con for others, it is for me.Conclusion: For this price point, one can blindly go for this. It is very much worth. I feel in the corner of my heart, this phone beats S10+ also (by comparing prices I meant).***No NFCNo water resistancePoor camera qualityFront cam has no clear pics mainly when you are below some light.No notifications light.Fingerprints are slow.Overall slow performance***This phone is quite good but I think I have choosen a wrong device I should choose Redmi note 7 pro because it has good camera then Samsung A50 as I have compared both phone in review units.***I had Redmi Note 5 pro and I wanted to buy Redmi note 7 pro but I got really sick of their flash sales trick. Hello Redmi, if you are listening, you lost a customer to Samsung because of your greedy cheap tricks.Pros and cons combined -1) If you are coming from Mi-ui it takes few days to get adjusted to Samsung one-ui. But again, I don't see a problem in the long run.2) I tried Samsung pay mini for first time buying groceries. Trust me, it's super easy and I can switch between PayTM / Bhim in a giffy because I use different bank accounts.3) Samsung pass is another thing which I loved. In this digital age remembering passwords is next to impossible. Samsung has this password manager which only opens with your biometrics. Brilliant! Also, it autofills fields from Samsung pass. Even brilliant!4) Earphones given with this phone are bad. I bought new ones. But that is acceptable at this price range.5)The length of charging cable is too short. If you have a spike buster on the floor, it won't even reach the study table. I had to buy new USB to type-c cable with a bigger length. This you will get in a local shop for 200 bucks.6) Super Amoled screen is absolutely fantastic.  All that extra money you are paying over and above Redmi note 7 pro is for this screen . It looks very premium,  Lovely colours and also saves battery . I am somebody who watches a lot of videos on YouTube and stream a lot of shows on Netflix. This is a perfect mini-tv for me. There are so many features to adjust the screen types and blue colour . It's brilliant and less strain on your eyes. So 5k extra may look premium price but I don't regret it because of the lovely screen quality!7) Adaptive brightness sensor is extremely brilliant. It keeps learning your patterns and it understands so well when you go out of the house or come in to the house . I had this problem with Redmi note 5 pro where I adjusted the screen brightness way too many times manually.8) In screen finger print scanner is good if not brilliant. Initially I thought it was badly designed because it took some time to unlock. After a few days you will understand how to keep your thumb and it unlocks in a giffy. Also one more point to add here is , if you put a screen guard you have to remove the fingerprints and re-add them . This is totally justified because the system has an additional layer in between screen and your thumb. Once you remove and re-add, It works like charm again :)9) I can use both my SIM cards and also a memory card. This is excellent because I have  loads of songs , pictures and files etc in my memory card. I don't store anything on my phone storage . I can just move the card from phone to phone hassel free and also at the same time not sacrifice a SIM card slot. This is one of the easiest and practical ways to do data transfer. This is why a dedicated memory card slot is very important. Who will sit and copy data for hours together ?10) Both front and back cameras are good at this price range. I may agree here that the images of Redmi note 7 pro might be slightly on the sharper side. But the difference is not so much . Sorry for being vernacular here . As they say in Hindi , the difference is ""unnis-bees ka farak"" (the difference is like difference between 19-20). Basic users like me don't even need to care for these very very minute details.11) 4 GB ram and octacore processor is more than enough for doing regular things like food ordering, online shopping on Amazon,  bank transfers. What else everyone does other than WhatsApp, FB, Instagram and LinkedIn? Nobody should be even remotely worried about processors and ram . 90% of the mid aged working class people don't do anything other than these and these specifications are good enough unless you play games. I don't play games so no comments there.12) Cellular call quality is good. Nothing to worry. Both SIM cards work on volte.13) 25 Mp front camera is brilliant for WhatsApp video calls. I don't know how but somehow I see Skype not hanging in this device. It runs smooth.15) I didn't like the Samsung keyboard. I use gboard from times immemorial. This is more of a personal keyboard preference.16) Battery is excellent. I binged a complete show of 8 episodes on Netflix for 6 hours.  I still had 15% battery.17) The weight balance of this device is excellent. Neither we feel top or bottom heavy. I had this issue with Redmi note 5 pro. I somehow thought it was top heavy and flipped out of my hand sometimes.***First Impression was Awasom Looks.Now after the usage number of things are not in sinkNegative:1. Very very bad processing speed.2. One UI is not up to the mark.3. Front Camera pictures are so soft.4. worst of all is this fingerprint scanner so dam slowPositive:1. The display is just awesome2.

Got it the next day.1. Cheap and third class camera. Clicked a pic from the primary camera in a dark with a little bit of light coming from another room. Camera is not up to the mark. Even if its day, you will see pixel issue and low clarity. Secondary camera, has the same issue.  After activating this phone, I got a notification to update the phone, I updated. And a couple of days ago, again I got the notification of system update. I thought that the second update may fix the pixel issue but i was wrong. Compared Samsung A7 and vivo v 15 pro camera. Samsung camera is far better than vivo camera. If you zoom a picture in vivo v 15 pro, you will able to see pixel issue and low clarity. 48 megapixels are just numbers, nothing else. Even videos are not that clear. I dont understand how people are giving 5/5 on camera quality. May be they have not checked it thoroughly. Once they will zoom they will see how disappointing the camera is.I am worried about the pop up camera. I often do WhatsApp video calling and on every call it comes out as the front camera is located there. I am worried if it will last. :(2. See the second pic, its a screenshot i have taken. Under lockscreen poster wallpaper, see the bug. The complete sentence is unreadable, you cant see what is written after ""is"" because it is unscrollable as its a software bug (during the lock screen of your phone, slide forward to the wallpapers, on top right you will see 3 dots, tap on it, go to the settings and you will see the bug. Its in every phone. I went to a vivo store to check if it is in another phone as well and yes it was there.3. U cant set a WhatsApp profile picture directly from the gallery as there is no option to set a WhatsApp profile pic. If you need to set a WhatsApp profile picture, u need to go to WhatsApp settings and upload a picture (boring way).4.  If a contact has multiple numbers, you cant dial the second number of same contact from the dial list. You need to go to contacts and then you can dial the second number of the same contact from the contact list.5. In file manager, if you go to WhatsApp and open the image, you cant scroll to next image. You need to go back and open the next image.Few other cons are there. Will share soon.Its an overpriced phone. It should be between 20k - 22k***First of all, a big thanks to Amazon for delivering the product on first day of release.Reviews based on 3 days of usage:- Screen is bigger and feather touch feel- camera clarity is superb, popup mechanism is an innovative and works well.- Fast charging works well, 0 -100 will be 90-100 mins. Tested and works well- Different levels of camera settings and modes are good.I couldn't find any consMay b a battery size, 3700 since it has fast charging support we wont feel it is an issue.Price range is another concern- but i got a good deal with exchange.I am not a gamer, so i dint test the performance by playing game like PUBG, the one who need good caemra phones with rich look they can go for it.***I have purchased this phone after compression with other phones of this price range.This phone is superb .. in each parameters. Battery is really sufficient for full day.Picture quality also very good and clear. My selfy taken  in night by this phone is attached.Phone comes with tampere glass and cover..which are perfectly fitted.2 Sim slaught and 1 separate slought for Memory card.No hang...No heat...Now i am using this phone for last 6 days...and happy with my choice.I recommend to purchase this one..***This is my first phone from vivo. No doubt it is really an awesome phone. From every angle it looks so stunning. Delivered by amazon on day of launch. Camera is brilliant. Exposure may be adjusted for bokeh effect. Adjustments also can be done for portrait selfie studio light. Night mode works so brilliantly. But 48 mp sensor is just a gimmick, photos are very soft if 48 mp photos are taken, otherwise no complaint with the camera. Wide also takes a great shot. Pop up selfie is the main attaraction for the phone and it works fine for face recognition. One complaint about the phone, the fingerprint unlock does not work properly for all the time. Battery is really good. Takes near about 2hrs for 0-full charge. Lasts for 2 days for normal users. No lag has been witnessed for heavy usage and multitasking.Overall a great phone to buy***Camera is worst...not upto the mark... i bought vivo phone first time after seeing the 32MP front cam but the pictures are like 8MP cam... rear cameras are another disappointment...we can see the pixel breaking as we zoom in a little.. like they advertise its not 48 milion pixel sensor.. pictures look like i shot them with a 12 mp cam other 2 cams are not at all helping in picture quality.. as some one said vivo n oppo are experimenting grounds for oneplus.. i think oneplus will launch a great phone after taking all this feedback..Display is niceBattery backup is also niceConnectivity is goodGood quality Back cover provided in the box.The specs will get 2 star for the phone and the selfie pop up got another star.Please dont waste ur money in this phone as i exchanged my old phone i cant return this.Thank u.***Waste of money***Need a Replacement or refund.. Waste of moneyHeating issue while charging, suddenly running app closed, suddenly google assistant got activated, normal call drops. Call drops even in whatsapp calling.***"

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud. Although having 3010 battery it's capable to last 5hours of use online and 10hours of offline use..Awesome phone 👌***nothing great, other than camera, facing a major problem while calling screen is not getting off and causing call drop, going call on mute, flash getting on etc.***Useless model, I purchased based on xioami quality.

Only problem is while adding picture contacts it does not take from contct book and we have to add the names manually.The torch is very dim. For senior citizens they need a more powerful torch as their eyesight will be poorer than us.There should be an android version also because then videos can be played very effectively and the old members can have contact with their dear ones through whatsapp and other such apps.The dock charging facility is very convenient for old people who may not be able to connect the charging cable correctly.***Purchased for my mom. Earlier used Aasan (i ball) for 4 years.This item not compatible with Hearing Aid as claimed. Screen lock gets fixed & battery has to be removed to unlock. Hands free speaker sounds not good.

Moreover, the product offers only a replacement and not a refund (unless you call amazon customer service). Something to bear in mind if you are thinking of buying this garbage..I would not recommend this product to anyone..P.S.: ""Three Cheers"" to the amazon customer service who understood the issue and offered a full refund though the return policy only mentioned replacements.***Purchased for my elder parent. Very loud quality at the time of ringing can listen to other rooms also. Very easy to operate and the keys are the bigger one. Recommended for Sr. citizens or who wants a basic phone with good quality.***this is a very good phone. I had bought their earlier model a few years ago for my mother and now this one as a replacement for that phone.

Simple to use with large buttons and a large font display , they are the best in market for senior citizensgood loud sound, big buttons, large font in display, charging cradle, a large handset so it is easy to hold for old people, these are some of the sensible features of this phone***No doubt, the product is good. But not functioning at present. I kept inside my side pant pocket, suddenly rain started, I ran and stood under the selter, when I reached my home and kept on the table and found all the key board lights are blinking including the torch also. I have tried to off the phone but could not. I had an impressions that may be due to moisturization and opened back side of the phone separated the battery and kept the phone under sun light for some times and tried after some times but not functioning. It seems that phone is to be repaired. Since the phone is under warranty, requesting your intervention to short out the said discrepancy at earliest please. Please do the needful and oblige.

I had ordered it for my father and he been complaining display isn't good so I thought he ain't used to it.. now that I'm home and I see the screen is weird and sometimes even becomes totally white and have to restart to fix it.

A good phone for cost value proposition (Cant really complain if you get a smartphone within 10k)b. Good audioc. Fast charging2. Negatives:a. Terrible photo qualityb. Quality Video calling not supportedc. Developed touch and display issues within 2 months of purchase (Even a 10k phone should provide at least this basic feature of robust touch and display)***I'm writing this review after 2months of buying and till now i haven't met with any kind of problem with this phone superb picture quality sound and good vedio quality and no hanging issue. Till date..***display:- 720p less resolution cause distorted pucturesbattety :- very goodperformance :- slower than expectedsound :- not more loudmatetial quality:- very good***It's one of  the best deals under 10 K bucks .Its battery life is good if you use it wisely ,you can play pubg for around 2-3 hrs nd still Have some power left. It's picture quality is great , great sound performance overall performance is good .But it's screen is really fragile and it's backcover is useless ,with a 5D tempered nd a good protective case you're good to go.***"

Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6.

The phone book too is numerical only. What is the use of storing certain numbers if you can't tag who it belongs to?***Build quality is good. Ringtone options are pretty bad. There are 24 to choose from but most of them are just nonsense. Voice quality seems good. Button layout is quite bad. For instance R is not for Redial. There is a dedicated P button that does not seem to have any use on our connections. There is no sense to the menu option. Had to consult the manual for everything from configuring the clock to finding out how to set quick dial buttons.***Merit:Looks good.Low sound key press/smooth keys.Has redial,hands free and memory(dialed list + speed dial with 2 button).Demerit :1. No back light, difficult in night, you need a separate light to use it.2. The memory is only till you restart. As my phone connected to router, any time I restart the memory wipes out. So everytime I need to set the speed dial so elder people can use.***Please don't buy for caller ID purpose if you have BSNL landline. This will not work since it uses FSK technology, while BSNL uses DTMF technology. Otherwise it's a good phone.***I had purchased this phone on 6th April 2019, till date everything is going perfectly. Sound is also very clear and ring tone also very good. I will recommend to purchase the phone. But only thing is that every time power should be connected to it. Else once power off, the phone will be dead. So better use a UPS if there is continously power cut.***"

Or I will work out myself as Omni is there. But it's far better than other phones... I waited for cover to arrive and it took me around 4 days wait to actually use this phone. Still holding good. Hope there will be more service centers from ZTE after Trump went after them. Device holds promise. Love the device. The ROM feels like crafted by Some LineageOs Dev.***I wasn't sure what a gaming phone can deliver when i ordered Red Magic but went by the reviews the device was receiving, I must say it punches above its weight. Its not just a gaming device but a device that can handle anything you throw at it and compelling games like PUBG or Asphalt are just one of them and add to it the over all UI, ease to handle, camera that's quite impressive to say the least. Don't think twice before buying this , Highly recommend***If you want a phone with power packed performance and impeccable gaming experience, Red Magic is the the device to have. Playing games is an experience like never before and the sound and RGB lights give an immersive feel while gaming. The camera on Red Magic also takes great pictures making the phone a clear winner with every thing you want***Cons :Phone is a bit heavy comparatively , no very heavy . Back is metal but it is a bit slippery .Pros : Games, wow . It's great phone with great config.***Red Magic delivers a punch like none other, Design , RGB lights, metal body, great camera and amazing sound while gaming. Pros - Camera, Gaming experience, Design, Screen Cons - Nothing I could think of at this price***Phone is good. but message is not working in my phone maybe problem in device or Sim I need a customer care number.***"

Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6.

I'm testing with every device like mobile, laptop, DSLR everywhere i got same result. So,I just return the product and please don't go with my review may be my product having any internal problem. But my experience is very bad.***Don't believe in big youtubers reviews this mic is not upto the mark.  300 rupees has more gain and better noise cancellation when connected to phone than this mic.***This is the best lav mic in this price range. Awesome sound quality. Bassy audio output. Nice pickup pattern. Overall great product. The wire is too long that you can stand at a distance of about 15 metres and still use this mic. But for short distance use it sometimes becomes a mess. It works best with smartphone. So I'm wondering why it needs a battery to work with cameras. If it worked the same way as it does in smartphones without requiring a battery, it would be awesome. Unfortunately it only works in camera mode, which require a battery when used with a camera.Anyway, the audio quality is awesome and unmatched in this price range.***I would say this is the best available Mic in this price range. This mic can be connected to your DSLR, Smarthones, Laptops etc.Pros :1. Long Wire2. Sound Quality is really good and richCons :1. It will pick background noise, if you are in a noisy environment. But you can use RecForge 2 Audio Recorder App in your smartphone to Remove All The Noises.Apart from that, it's all gold. Go for it 😊***Product quality was good.. not bad.The build was also good. But one thing I want to say that please mention that it require a connector to connect with DSLR most of entry level DSLR or should provide a connector for DSLR that is very useful and helpful for the customers, because the connecter not available in any local market and when it buy through online shops some of it doesn't support the mic facility so we can't get a proper product which support the mic and DSLR. I bought the product about I think 2weeks ago but still the product is in new condition that is it is in the box only because I didn't get any connector suitable to connect with DSLR and mic. So kindly provide your own genuine connector for connecting with DSLR, it is a good and helpful for customers who is buying this product. Most of all customers are buying it for DSLR so kindly do it for your valuable customers.***I have bought this microphone after seeing many YouTuber reviews in multiple language. But it is better than expected. Some of them given bad review about this microphone, anyway they should consider their output device also. Because some mobile phones have low output quality. When plug any other devices, it gives much quality than previous. In my case, laptop and PC are better output device for this microphone. So don't write review blindly before check with lot of cases. Your bad and blind review will divert best mic expected persons in bedget.***This is the best lavalier mic in the price range. It is very sensitive and picks up the voice quite clearly. But, it picks up background noise as well. The pin to hold the mic is plastic and very cheap and it just got broke when I tried to adjust the mic with it. The Cabel is really long so, won't be a problem to use with your DSLR, mobile or digital audio recorder.***awesome item...the  ailudio  quality is  good ...  the  best part is that u cn  connect it  with any  Home  theater  and switch on the  mic ...  then  u cn use it  as microphone***"

Hence last time I did not give detailed feed-back.However  within just about 3 months time, I am having rethink about the product...First, the phone started giving  trouble in the month of October. Its speaker got broken down.Then I got it replaced. I was told,it was not within the warranty....! Hence,I had to pay from my pocket...Just thereafter, it again started troubling me. Theere was continuous noisy sound in the speaker and receiving calls were difficult,.Hence, again took the phone for servicing. This time, I was informed that the charger was not right. The phone requires 6.5 volts output AC Adapter, whereas I had received 5.5 Volts adapterr along with the phone. Hence, once again, I had to pay to get the chrger replaced with a 6.5 Volts adapter.After paying more than Rs.1000.for these repairs / replacements,I was relaxing ,thinking that I will have a trouble free service hereafter. But No I was wrong, .....This time its speaker againg got down God knows why...!!Then I took the gadget to a different service outlet...On thorough inquiries, I received a detailed reply...That the phone is made in Malaysia,its electric input standards are different than our domestic electric supply which is 220 volts .. Hernce the product does not and will Not run satisfactorily here in India...I am now stuch with this phone which purchase cost was 2500.and after spending another Rs.1000. and several visits to the different service outlets and lot of headache,the gadget sits on my table without giving me ant service at all.I am unable to know what should I do with it. The Amazon site tells me that the return window is now closed.I now feel cheated by Rs. 3500 + other expensesI feel,either the Amazon should take the gadget back and refund at least the cost or should STOP selling such defective products in India.....!I expext a reply from Amazon on the issues raised by me at the earliest...***this is not a made for india product, as its evident from the packaging. It has Chinese or Arabian letters on the keypad (there are english as well on it).  I would have give this 5* if it was meant to be sold in India. Else everything is working fine. This has a UK type power plug, so won't go directly into indian sockets.***Good DECT phone. Keypad illuminated.phone have good range and voice clarity is good.White LCD backlite. The people who is complaining for arabic , in my phone it is not so and really i check the range is very good and very good voice clarity, it is very good experience to use the phone. some people will say guarantee not valid in INDIA but first thing this is complicated electronic and normally does not malfunction and in case of malfunction customer care people does not have deep knowledge to solve, so go and buy it, specially for key pad illuminated and good voice clarity at a long distance. Used it around 2 month***In just 2 months time, the adapter has failed and the service center is not accepting to replace the same because no warranty card was provided with the product. Very bad experience. Never expected the product to fail in just 2 months that too from a trusted brand like amazon...***I have been using this product approximately over 10 months. Here are the few pros and cons bases on my experienceCons: The cost appear a bit higher but it's worth every penny. I did not observed any other problem with this set.Pros:1. Excellent range and coverage for the cordless.2. Battery lasts mostly 2 days on medium/high usage.Charging is really fast.3. Display is bright enough.***I am using this phone from last two months. It works perfectly fine with my Wifi router(Airtel) in Delhi. The wifi router is placed next to this phone and it flawlessly works fine without any noise or disturbance.It also works when there is no power supply. You just need to place the phone over the base and place a call in the speaker mode.***Its not under warrenty here in india. the screen blanked out in just two months of use.***Works good.Initially setting were in some different language.

Within 4 months of its purchase, the only speaker has started misbehaving for the second time. I got it repaired and now again it has reached the same stage. Nokia needs to develop/reopen its service centers back.***Right from the beginning the set is not functioning  properly.The issues are:1. Calls do not go through many times even when the signal strength is very good.2. Contact numbers are getting jumbled up / mixed up with other contacts3. Either the mike or speaker stop functioning / erratic. Either my voice is not heard on other side or other side could not be heard.Amazon has disowned responsibility so also Nokia.This was complained to Amazon, but of no help.

All the selling features of this phone turn out to be disadvantages in the longer run.-> Durable - Phone starts feeling really heavy really soon-> Carl Zeiss lens - But software that processes images is crap-> Android One - Just a blunder. Provides you with unlimited storage on cloud. Sounds awesome, doesn't it. It will take a day or two for you to realize that the phone does not have a local gallery at all. All the images reside in the cloud so you cannot (I am shaking my head in disbelief) You cannot see your pics when there is no internet.***Dislike1. Camera quality - bad2.

Google's User Experience people are a bunch of complete morons...The only positive side of this phone is the built quality and hardware. software part sucks...Note: After updating its OS to Android Pie Nokia OZO Audio gone ... So no premium audio experience with this device anymore.You can not skip this update guys... so no special audio enhancements.I am thinking of returning this useless junk.So Beware of this issues with the phone guys...***A bit on a heavier side, feels quite big for a single hand usage..Heating issues initially which is now sorted over subsequent android security updates..Camera is amazing in day light, enough for non detailing purpose or mobile photography..Performance is quite good not as bad as seen in reviews, even the fingerprint touch is quick.Bought this for 11,600₹,13,999₹ -1,399₹ (10%) -1,000 (cashback)4gb/64gb variant is good with the performance and the metallic colour n all metal unibody!Was hesitant initially looking at the reviews but when actually put in use for few days, doesn’t feel as bad as the reviews seen!There are lots of other portals with complete reviews and videos.Everyone has their own needs and expectations, this suited mine..Notch and bezel less design, I’m afraid I would break it easily so I went for this model...***"

When i set the battery by adding a SIM card in it, and try to switch it on, it starts, but by pressing any key it goes switch off. after so many times, i found that the battery get disconnected by pressing any keys frequently any time. so you have to use this mobile like a cup of glass. If mobile pressed little bit in pocket, it goes switch off. if press the lock button little harder, mobile goes switch off. Really bad device if you wont get a proper model or tough body mobile.

The battery life is less than 7 months. After 6 months it is not even coming for one phone call. The bad part is that they give battery warranty only for 6 months.

I brought this product for my senior citizen mother who is 80 years with multiple problems of parkinson, hearing problem and arthiritis and usual age related ailments ( loneliness - esp after the loss of her companion of 56 years a few years back. Easyfone has become her second best companion after me her son with whom she can keep in touch with with it's better speech quality and easy big digit pad and clock etc. In her over eagerness to keep the phone charged always she has been keeping it plugged on always which led to the battery going bad on the 11th month of the one year warranty. One call to the Seniorworld executive at gurgaon the battery was replaced without extra charge and even though I had purchased it through amazon. I recommend this simple easyfone a must have all senior elders at home.SeniorWorld Senior Citizen Friendly Easyfone (Black)***I Love the phone, Delivered in my friend’s house and brought it here in Saudi Arabia ahead of the said delivery date, Good for the elderly  and I can’t wait to Bring this in the Philippines and  give to my Uncle.***This phone is basically for uneducated and very old age persons. They can't read English. There is no Telugu language. An educated elder person can use smartphone. It is very difficult to operate. No shortcut options. Sos function is not working properly, it is repeatedly calling sos numbers until we turn off sos.***My search for phone with large keys and legible font ended as soon as I found easyfone..I'm glad that I bought not one but 3 phones..Elders in my family loved it ..They enjoy the radio feature and are also glad to listen to old and devotionl songs with the help of dedicated micro sd card (slot provided)Cradle charger enables them to simply place the phone in it rather than going through the trouble of finding a small charger point..Overall I definitely recommend it as I said I purchased 3 phones..Big thank you and 👍👍***"

Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand👌👌Picture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.👍I saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***"

You never have an option from Amazon for return for this product as they only offer you a exchange which is annoying when the phone itself if not compatible, how will a return/replace will work. Better to go with Redmi or other branded phone which really would be worth buying .***I got this phone @ very good cost after exchange.. merely 7000... I haven't had read reviews as well.. There was nothing to think, i directly purchased it..  to my surprise, this phone came out to be exceptional.. Very good battery life, display, sound quality..

There are lots of actually smart features inside which are useful in day to day use ---- i wud say actually a smart phone.. Also got one-time free screen replacement in the offer period..

It's slim and looks sexy but the UI is not of my taste. One thing everyone knows that you'll never get next upgrade of android in these device/Brands(for cheap phones) because of the crowd of these phone from ViVO. Finally I would say Excellent phone but if you are little aware of software upgrades and upcoming security, just think once.Amazon shopping experience is always being better and better and no doubt quick delivery and better packaging for an ordinary customer(non-prime).Have a nice shopping .***The phone is good and great deal in 6600 due to exchange during sale period. The salients are:-Average display but size great size, performs  smoothly on normal task but slow compare to same category rivals. Battery one dag normal use. Finger print  face lock works well. Camera main is ok type, selfie camera not at par, no dim light option. Camera is just acceptable. 2 sim and 1 memory card slot is good.  Some unique features in cluttered funOS UI copied from apple. Overall not so good in 13-14 k but ok in sub 10k range.***Headache phone, audio doesn't play sometimes while watching YouTube videos, Face unlock occasionally works, it's new phone and its stucking, Im fed up with this and tried for exchange and to my surprise I was shocked by seeing the exchange price 1/3rd of the original price. Plz don't buy n become fools like me.***Camera is good if you have severe self esteem issues, the selfie camera just distorts your face into something bizarre. You look bleached in the photos taken using front camera. I just hate that.

Not found any speed drops in the middle.Able to connect my 2TB Hard disk and access files over FTP on both laptop and mobile.Not found any disconnection.Easy setup and device software updated over wi-fi.I can control my device using phone.Getting good range of signal.All LAN ports are having same Gigabit output.Connected 4 phones and 3 laptops at a time played UHD videos without lag.Really worth for the price.***I'm not a speed freak and have a very modest 50mbps cable line but the one feature that had me interested in fancy, pricey routers was the USB 3 port and the potential for having a NAS for cheap. Now this isn't the cheapest router with USB3 but it surely is one of the fastest. If you look at the router reviews at SmallNetBuilder, you'll find that not many routers can give you true USB3 speeds.While a PC might give you around 110MBps read/write with portable HDDs, ~180MBps r/w with powered HDDs and ~450MBps with portable SSDs over USB3, most routers can only manage around 30-50MBps r/w.But this one gives me 90-110MBps read and 60-80MBps write (over gigabit ethernet) which is very respectable. File transfers over 5GHz WiFi is around 30-40MBps. Transferring a 17GB image folder did slow it down to 20-30MBps vs 60-70MBps on PC.So for the price that I paid (9K) and with the multiple hard disk that I had lying around which got converted to NAS for cheap, I'd say this was a great deal.Oh and the routing feature itself is fine I guess :) In my 1300 sq. ft. house the reception is just not a problem, even with the old ISP router (D-Link 615). I compared their strengths from my balcony which is the farthest point away from the router. This got -56dBm the old one dropped to -60dBm. So again, not why I bought this!Update 1: Make sure to change your Hard Drive sleep settings otherwise the drive will keep spinning (unnecessary wear). The router can't put the drive to sleep like windows but thankfully you can set that separately with a manufacturer specific software like SeaGate Dashboard or WD Ware (don't about other brands)Update 2: Ok, so the dual core CPU, 512MB RAM and decent sequential file transfer speed is not enough for using this with Adobe apps. Premiere Pro hangs when loading footage from the drive. So I'm just going to use this purely as a file storage drive from now on.Update 3: The file transfer speed when transferring a folder with several small sized files is really slow (around 5KBps!) and the only way is to archive them into a zip file. I'm changing my review title from ""Great"" to strictly ""Okay"".***Awesome Product...I had a Tplink Archer C20 which stopped working after 2 years...I have a 100mbps connection and for the first time i could experience Wifi Speeds of more than 100mbps(5ghz) and 80mbps(2.4ghz) on my Iphone and about 80-90mbps(5ghz) and 50-60mbps(2.4ghz) on my laptop...The previous router never gave me more than 60mbps on wifi....Thats an awesome upgrade....Although, the Range in this router is less than my previous router, it doesnt matter as i have a Range extender and even the range extender which is about 100ft away from my router is able to give me speeds of over 30mbps at 2.4ghz which was not even giving me 8mbps before...Dont even try the 5GHZ channel for more than 30ft as thats the limit of its range...But 2.4ghz even reaches ground floor of my building..i live on 3rd floor...But that happens because my router sits near the window...But its in my bedroom and it has cross 2 walls before reaching my Hall...But 30mbps in Hall is great for now !!!Setup took me just 5 mins as i did not have to update Mac Id of this router with my ISP (You Broadband) and this router connects to the Modem and Internet within few seconds of starting which is very fast compared to old router which used to take more than 5 mins to connect....So surely, this is an awesome product...i love it !!!***Guys currently Amazon is shipping ver 2 hardware which is not compatible with cable broadband like Alliance Broadband, Hathway, etc. You will get good download speed. But there will be no upload speed. Ver 1 is for India and other Asian countries. Ver 2 is for Europe and lastly Ver 3 is for sale in US.***Update: I am revising my review for this product. TP link released a new firware after few months and on updating the latest firmware the router is working good for past few months. The overall experience of using this router is good. Now I can recommend buying this product.Update: after 3 months the router is abruptly freezing from time to time and I am not able to connect any device to the wifi network. Only after I reboot I am able to reconnect to wifi network. Tp link India support centre have no clue what's wrong. Don't buy this product there is a flaw in this product.Initial review after buying:Good product with USB port, beamfoarming in AC and gigabit Ethernet. Range is ok.***Awesome speed experience in this router, gigabyte router which is output with great speed ever I experienced before... Excellent... This product is really match for your high speed broadband internet***Very happy with this router, easy to setup and most importantly connect right away with PPPoE serivie(Earlier I bought NetgearR6800(r/s 7499) , which was not able to connect to Internet with PPPoE serivce).Interface is smooth and simple and very fast. Coverage is good for both bands( 2.5G and 5G).Haven't found any connection or speed drops.Also you can connect USB printer and share it via this router. I will totally recommend this router. Real value to money.***It does everything I need it to do. It lacks features like MIMO but I don't really need it right now. I have a 100mbps connection and get 85-94mbps wired and 75-85mbps over Wifi. Setup is very easy and the mobile app helps for easy monitoring. I have had no issues in the few months that I have owned this router and is more reliable than other routers in this price bracket.***"

Please read it completely. . disappointed with camera. The camera is regular. The selfie flash makes the photo look bad. It's written 32gb. I know a few gbs are not shown in storage. But I'm left with just 25gb!!!!!😞.. Also phone is easy to slip. Sound quality is very average. Battery life stinks, absolutely stinks. it is shown that you can have up to 12 hours of gaming on this but it is not as shown. I've played pubg on this phone and after one hour of playing it one third of the battery is drained. Also it gets very hot when you play  for some time. Fingerprint sensor is pretty fast. Don't waste your money on this, there are better phones in the same price range***A very good budget phone, for someone who is not going to use phone for anything and everything this is the right choice, if you're looking for a 8k-9k budget good phone for your mom, dad or someone who's not going to play/download a lot of games. After a year use sometime it acts a little kinky when it runs out of battery completely, it goes completely off and takes time to come alive even after plugging in the charger, overall- budget phone for little elderly people***mere fone me audio problem aa gai h but me mi service senter leke gya to unhone warranty me mobile thik krne ko mna kr diya he bola apka fone damage he but mere fone ke mother board me problem aai h to use thik krkre dena chahiy jo mi senter wale nhi kr rhe he or unhone mere fone ka estimate 55 hundred + amt bataya he please help on this mettersaddam8200892899***Very bad 16 megapixel selfie camera camera is very good but this mobile 3 week using this mobile Lagan Lag no but just like keep your mind just one time but I'm liking this phone I am using this phone but selfie camera is good and you buy this phone keep your mind one thing this phone battery backup is good then Global Ram update 10 ROM update KMPlayer not just lying ok looks percussion but good good quality and good body final and good will quality please friends by this phone but 32GB no friends 3GB Ram mobile please bhai 4GB ram 64GB mobile my friendsMIUI 9MIUI 9 is loaded with system-level customizations and optimizations for performance and battery life.

All you need is the username and password for your broadband connection.The ISP(Bsnl, Airtel) will give it to you.  Also, you must know the time zone (GMT +5:30) and country (India) for setting it up foe the first time. If the telephone cble is connected, it automatically detects the ISP. You just enter username and password for broadband and start using it.It does not have dynamic QoS. And the specs about the processor, RAM, and Rom(or flash) are absolutely unknown. The settings in the router webpage are unnecessarily complicated compared to JioFi webpage, but maybe useful for power users. So keep that in mind.Also, the processor is probably, single core at about 300MHz. So that could explain the low price.  And updating firmware could be tedious, if an update is released. Another problem in your life.***This router is literally a striped down version of w8968. I got the v3 and the chipset used is mediatek. Hence the low features as compared to Broadcom SoC. Slow processing due to low ram and can't use any lan port as wan for any future upgrades. The ui typical of mediatek is very very confusing and restrictive for a normal person, had to set it up for my friend. I guess the price difference between this and the competition like dlink etc is because of the old and slow chipset used. But for normal use its pretty stable.***# No issues. Nothing impressive.# Compatible with basic BSNL broadband connection.# Sometimes it lags a little but quite manageable.# One need to consult the nearest BSNL office to configure the modem. Hardly takes 10 minutes.# All necessary wiring stuffs, adapter are present.# Has 2 slots to hang it on the wall.# Better than the single antenna modem, considering coverage.# Light weight compared to older models, which happens looks the same.# Price: Rs 1499.***This is complicated product. While tested with MTNL landline phone it not work. Even with its normal setting with smart device like mobile phone, it not work. Only three lights are blinks and forth light that is for internet access does not blink even after ten minutes! The product is tested at the similar time while my old Netgear set is working with the same MTNL phone line. Some manufacturing/technical error defect with this product. I have returned. Please ensure the refund id truly made. If some reply to this comment and if corrective seller/Amazon may please guide me, I shall be further interested to this product just because of this product's manufacturing built quality.***I face connectivity issues every single day now.

Earlier i used to have Redmi note 5, when i buyed this redmi y2 i found that there is no  change , they are too similar. This phone body is made of plastic which looks like metal . I really miss glass finish at back of the phone.

Battery will last for more than one day (I'm not a gamer, but the phone was connected to WiFi throughout the day and I used the phone reasonably well during the whole day)5.Good UI and frequent updatesCons:1. Rear camera is not great. But yes, it does its job decently.2. Battery capacity could have been more since phones with higher battery capacity is available in the same price range.3. Headset is not provided in the package. The clear case provided attracts finger prints and dirt.4. Fast charger is not provided. But this is fine as phones in same price range normally don't have fast chargers.5. Speaker performance is not that great6. Lags are rarely observed while using depth mode in camera.***Totally waste dont buy .. battery back up poor...display not working sometime . Display quality not at all good***"

As per the suggestion I went to a Nokia care and after seeing the phone's display problem and the bill they bluntly told that the phone is under replacement warranty and they are not supposed to give support. From there I called up Amazon customer care and narrated the same. The lady over phone also spoke with the Nokia care personnel but she also could not come out with any solution and insisted me to try other service centre. As per the discussion I showed the phone and the bill to another Nokia service centre which is almost 75 km away from the previous one. But the wording of the Nokia service personnel is same as before that this particular model is under replacement warranty and they are not authorised to do anything. Now I would request Amazon from whom I have bought the phone to give me a solution for this. Hope you understand my problem and resolve the issue.Thanks.***Faltu phone plz dont Buy this product..even at 50%. Within one month Display Gone.poor sound Quality.After going to Service Center They denied to repair the phone coz of i brought the phone from Amazon.than after i called amazon tollfree they told to get me Denied letter.Now i have to Dance here an there?***First off this product is a Beauty. Being an old Motorola Fan, I feel Nokia has done well w.r.t. this phone design.Many may complain, that build quality is not that great, but I beg to defer.I feel the build quality is superb for its price, the display is cool, that curve is sexy.Being so used Power Thirsty Mobiles, the new 3310 was charged to 100% a couple of days' ago, and even after fiddling it, playing music, FM Radio, it still shows a full Battery. I am going to wait to see when I need to charge it next, will post that information in about a week's time.So based on the price I paid, here is my overview of the product (I am not giving the specs here, that is available on the website.)That dual SIM + microSD card option is an awesome addition to this tiny phone. I have placed a 32GB memory card in there.Excellent - Build Quality, Display, Camera, Size, Weight, Keypad, Navigation, Voice reception, and mic.Good - Inbuilt speaker, Headset.Bad - Nothing (In my opinion, have everything I need in this phone for this price)***really very very amazing phone. build quality is very good it looks like premium phone. its easy to use and it is a handy phone. in my family most of all the family members uses nokia 3310 as a secondary phone. Batteryry backup is good camera quality is also good. i use this mobile in last 1 year and i didn't face any problem or my mobile also fall on the floor many times but there is no crack in the phone or there is no scratch in the phone body. Yea the price of this phone is bitter high but if you want a premium quality phone they go with it. I Love This Phone.***I not get battery good***Got this phone for my mom who didnt want any internets or whatapps. It looks very cute. But audio is poor, and speaker quality is also poor. I expected better from this iconic phone of the 2000's.***Defective piece. Cursor key not working on pressing. Disappointed. On replacement reauest courier guy came but didnot pick up the set rather told contact amazon office***The build quality is very bad and ipurchase it after some time the  flash light is automatically stop doing then i returned it next dayMy experience is very bad.***"

I am using it in my note 8 and when I try to record slowmotion videos, the recording gets stuck instead of being a smooth one.

I also tested the 64 GB U3 variant and it showed a write speed in between 55 and 65 MB/s while copying to the card. So in my case, the 128 GB card showed good results.

The phone has already got latest Oreo update, along with enhancements to sound, performance and camera.Camera is great at this price band.The biggest issue is that it does not support dual 4G Standby as described in the specs. Only one SIM will become 4G while the other will shift to 3G/2G. That is ridiculous. I bought it on seeing the features shown on the product page saying ""Dual 4G Dual Standby"

Now coming to the productNice in budget smartphones... What I liked is good battery with fast charging, nice front camera for video call, rear camera is fine, included back cover and screen protector in box also earphones means not required to purchase extra things, android go means will be providing update for 2 years... Speaker also good, one more thing which I like is gestures like double tap wake up and when screen is off and you make 'V' its flash is lit...Only the main negative point is ram is 1gb that doesn't allow to run two apps simultaneously... I also would have preferred 2gb variant but when I purchased, its 2gb variant was not released in market...Overall well and good...Today when the representative took feedback on call and asked about rating, I told that will give 4 stars for which he didn't convinced for more and only replied to write a review...

It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category.Pros:Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM .Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to)Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones.Sound is good -clear and audible.Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though.Sturdy phone for long durability.Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale.Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera. (Don't expect much from basic phone, because it is to simplify needs).***Best basic mobile with front camera and front flash, and good battery life in this price, and mobile is easy to use, but I feel sound is low compared to other mobiles..***It’s a gift for my mom, as she is not tech savvy and is not into smart phones.

Its been 5 days and no pick up arranged. I got this phone for my aged mother who is comfortable to use a feature phone.  The purpose is lost when you cant hear the conversation.Will Amazon/seller help me with replacement.  This is still in warranty period***This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it.Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments.Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied.Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons)Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders.Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan.Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.***No metal parts.. feels a very cheep phone... Screen was not that much good.***Sound quality is best.Image quality is best as far as this small handset is considered.Thw only one thing i disliked is that nokia changed the keypad locking style (in old models it was press OK and then *.

Even after two months, I couldn't find a better phone in this range, 10-14K.***This is a really very good phone. it worth the money. I used it since January 2014.  Camera quality is pretty good compared to many other phone. Selfies comes really well.

It looks sleek and comes properly packed with neat instructions on features.Contrary to some reviews here, this is actually a good phone for wall mount. I have mounted it on wall and have not faced any issue. You need to pull out the small square part on the base plate (refer the picture attached with this review) and put it back upside down. This will create a small hinge on which receiver piece can fit perfectly when put in place.Sound quality is good. I can hear it ring from all corners of my 3 BHK home even when put on minimum sound setting.***Nice and Trendy corded landline phone. Occupies very little space due to its compact design. However a few cons i.e. the ringer volume is a bit low. Cannot be heard clearly in a relatively loud environment. Also display feature is an eyewash as the numbers on display are very small.Rest all good.***"

It actually looks very elegant in any setting. But the major problem is that it does not work the way it is supposed to. It is NOT wall mountable !!!

It looks sleek and comes properly packed with neat instructions on features.Contrary to some reviews here, this is actually a good phone for wall mount. I have mounted it on wall and have not faced any issue. You need to pull out the small square part on the base plate (refer the picture attached with this review) and put it back upside down. This will create a small hinge on which receiver piece can fit perfectly when put in place.Sound quality is good. I can hear it ring from all corners of my 3 BHK home even when put on minimum sound setting.***Nice and Trendy corded landline phone. Occupies very little space due to its compact design. However a few cons i.e. the ringer volume is a bit low. Cannot be heard clearly in a relatively loud environment.

I felt the buttons use rubber cushions and hence might have problems during rainy season due to the moisture and fungus. I haven't experienced it as I got it after the rainy season. Just a small thing to consider. Otherwise its a very good product especially ideal for elder people.***The device is a pretty return of value for money. So you have pretty decent sound quality and durability. You have a speaker phone facility as well though it isn't as good as it could be, but fairly good at this price.***Good basic phone, has a 3 step volume adjuster, tone/pulse dial selector and last number redial facility.  Ear piece volume is pretty good even for the old, slightly hearing impaired people.  Mouthpiece (Output) volume is pretty loud too.  Clear speech.  No issues with receiving and making calls.  The default (only!) ringtone is ok and can be heard well inside a small apartment.  The reason for not giving 5 stars is this phone does not have any option with the ringtone.***"

All you need is the username and password for your broadband connection.The ISP(Bsnl, Airtel) will give it to you.  Also, you must know the time zone (GMT +5:30) and country (India) for setting it up foe the first time. If the telephone cble is connected, it automatically detects the ISP. You just enter username and password for broadband and start using it.It does not have dynamic QoS. And the specs about the processor, RAM, and Rom(or flash) are absolutely unknown. The settings in the router webpage are unnecessarily complicated compared to JioFi webpage, but maybe useful for power users. So keep that in mind.Also, the processor is probably, single core at about 300MHz. So that could explain the low price.  And updating firmware could be tedious, if an update is released. Another problem in your life.***This router is literally a striped down version of w8968. I got the v3 and the chipset used is mediatek. Hence the low features as compared to Broadcom SoC. Slow processing due to low ram and can't use any lan port as wan for any future upgrades. The ui typical of mediatek is very very confusing and restrictive for a normal person, had to set it up for my friend. I guess the price difference between this and the competition like dlink etc is because of the old and slow chipset used. But for normal use its pretty stable.***# No issues. Nothing impressive.# Compatible with basic BSNL broadband connection.# Sometimes it lags a little but quite manageable.# One need to consult the nearest BSNL office to configure the modem. Hardly takes 10 minutes.# All necessary wiring stuffs, adapter are present.# Has 2 slots to hang it on the wall.# Better than the single antenna modem, considering coverage.# Light weight compared to older models, which happens looks the same.# Price: Rs 1499.***This is complicated product. While tested with MTNL landline phone it not work. Even with its normal setting with smart device like mobile phone, it not work. Only three lights are blinks and forth light that is for internet access does not blink even after ten minutes! The product is tested at the similar time while my old Netgear set is working with the same MTNL phone line. Some manufacturing/technical error defect with this product. I have returned. Please ensure the refund id truly made. If some reply to this comment and if corrective seller/Amazon may please guide me, I shall be further interested to this product just because of this product's manufacturing built quality.***I face connectivity issues every single day now.

But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7"") and XR the biggest(6.1""), with X and XS with same size(5.8""), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps.***Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.***Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon***So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there’s a glitch in the front camera’s portrait mode. That’s fine, it may happen. But what’s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!***It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.***The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you.***Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon***"

Yesterday on 23rd (11th day of the purchase), was started not working. I was switched off the mobile while going to a meeting and again switched on after the meeting. Then, the mobile showing- Encryption problem"". I have submitted to the Samsung service centre along with invoices and they told that- ""it may be happen due to the interruption of updates"" and it takes 4-5 days to come to a decision.I would like to draw your attention that, the phone simply become dead when I switched off.Since it was purchased ""ONLINE"" through Amazon, who will give the immediate support? The service centre is mentioning the lengthy procedure for which I have no time because I am travelling to Germany and France on 27th Oct. Usually, the return duration shall be one month on Amazon. Why it was closed in 10 days?It was a new piece and for simple reason, the phone was dead which was a manufacturing defect.I request you to consider the case and allow us for replacement in a day or two as I am the Prime customer. I have never returned any goods so far.***mobile gets heat even normal usage like chatting,talking,camera & browsing. Totally worst experience from top brand.  amazon not ready to immediate for replacememt they consider mobile temperature more than 45 c only. But now im facing 40 c eventhough this much of heat they are not ready to listen customer concern.***Best phone ever.... camera of phone is too good very nice camera quality but proccessor & graphic not so good for the games .. but over are phone are nice in this price 👍***Pros :Front CameraDisplayBattery lifeIP6 certified dust and water resistantSamsung payRAMCons:Processor is not upto the mark considering the price range.Rear camera is not good.Device although has premium look but feels heavy in hand.Face unlook is not accurate.No 4K Video recordingFast Charging i observed is 1% per minute which is not much appreciated.Finally what i suggest is if you are getting this device around 22K and you are more concerned with Samsung branding like me then you can go with this device but spending 30K for this device is obviously not a good choice better go with 1Plus 5T or 1Plus 6***Let me start by saying that there are better phones in this price segment. But, if you find this phone in less than or around 20k just go for it. Its a flagship like feel. Build quality and battery life is super. Screen is just what you need. Its a Amoled display which meets expectations. Sound wise performance is superb ( Dolby support). Signal quality you can't complain about. Now, average or below average part is its camera. In daylight condition its quite good, but in poor lighting conditions it totally fails. Like a Mi phone of 10k performs better than it. This is the only downside i felt. I have been using it for now more than a month. I purchased it for 18k during tbe big billion days offers. A lot of people complain about it fingerprint sensor, let me say that it is very fast. And also the face unlock feature is not bad. It performs in low light conditions as well. I swear to it. Overall if you are normal user and not than much photogenic or selfie freak you are not going to regret it. Its a good phone after all. I am totally safisfied with it. It only there would have been wireless charging support it would be a killer.***I have Orderd this phone in Oct 2018.Aftet using a few week I m proving my feedback.1. Phone is nice2. Great 6GB RAM3. When you purchased this phone you get Android 7.1 but whan you connect the Internet your Android version will be updated with 8.4. Camera is not adequate but front camera really awesome.5. Battery backup Good as compared to other phone.6. You will also also get Free back cover in your box.7. Led Notifiaction available8. Both SIM are 4G and LTE supported means you can use both SIM simultaneously as 4G.9. Get Blue light filter for youe eyes protection.10. You can also get PANIC support by pressing 3 button.***Very disappointed with the quality of the product.In fact, I liked the feel and the software UI of the Galaxy A8+But unfortunately, it didn't last one full day. Within 24hrs of use, the screen was dead. It wouldn't turn on, nor efforts for a hard reset or charging the mobile, helped any further.Samsung needs to tighten it's QC further. There are plenty of reports online, which make it evident that the company has a very poor QC over their manufacturing process. I wonder, why is it this way with Samsung (a company that produces great flagship mobiles).Have initiated returns. Now, would think twice before buying a smartphone produced by Samsung.***Excellent phone. Fast delivery.***"

Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand👌👌Picture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.👍I saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***"

Network is excellent. It does everything you could ask for in a basic phone.  I would say music player, camera and audio recorder and some additional feature are just a huge bonus.Battery life is also good, it even has Vibration which I haven't seen in other phones in this price point.However, be very of one thing, if you are talking to someone using your earpiece. The other person sitting next to you can hear your conversation. The earpiece of the phone is THAT loud. I suggest lowering the volume of the call.***This mobile phone replaced my old nokia one as it is giving more battery backup with dual sim support. The backup is more (upto 4 days standby and 1.5 days in moderate use) in single sim mode than (upto 3 days standby and 2 days in moderate use) in dual sim mode. This was the primary expectation from this mobile and it didn't disappoint me either. I will post subsequent backup details after heavy usage.The other features are quite similar to normal budget phones available in the market. The SD card support is excellent for those who want to listen songs in this, but the speaker sound it too low. In-ear calling is OK. Headphone support is there too. In the organizer section, it's got bluetooth, alarm, calender, world clock, tasks and flashlight. It also got option to browse internet (in case of emergencies :P) Don't even expect from sound and camera quality, though it is capable of taking clicks after putting a SD card.Couldn't ask for more for this price actually. Great going QFX. Hope they have good service too.The look and feel is smooth. Keys are handy even for bigger hands, the middle navigation button is cool and they are backlit for night use. The UI is usual as other phones. Takes normal full size sim.I think this is definitely a winner considering price to feature scenario.***This is a very bad mobile.ringtone is very low.camera is not good. Don't go for this.only earpiece is good sound.audio sound is not loud also. Very very slow sound.***very unique phone.***I hope you are just buying this product for callings and for that this ia best in this price because it is so cute and beautiful phone and very useful for common use i.e. call listings and contacting***The audio quality is pathetic. The ringtone and sound are almost inaudible if you are on road. It has a decent battery though. It does not come with earphone and its FM requires an earphone as an antenna. Of course at this price you cannot expect much except for the fact that the sound could have been a bit better.***Mobile volume is vary low. on vary keen observation only we will know that the mobile is ringing. it is vary much inconvinient to aged people the user of the mobile.***This worst product.

The mobile set was being used very carefully and  no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests  with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now.

I put my Kindle on it sometimes too, makes reading easy.Let tell you the good and bad of this product.Good:1) Very solid build. Made completely of heavy metal2) It is plainly visible that the design is inspired from the monitor stand of the Apple Mac Desktop, which is a good thing. Looks stylish.3) Has rubberised base and rubber straps where the phone will rest so has a good grip4) MAKE IN INDIA initiative. And that is stamped boldly on it.Now for the bad:1) Price is a bit too more than it should have been.Verdict:If you want a good stand for your phone or tablet, go for it***Build well, seems pretty sturdy. Not the best look wise , kinda looks like metal catching rust, but that doesn't affect the performance of the product. Seems like it will last a while.  However, there is one LARGE product design flaw. The distance of the phone once placed on the stand is in itself okay, but when you plug a charger in , this distance is too little, causing the charging wire to bend a lot for the phone to be able to sit snug in the stand. If you take the wire from outside and plug it in there are no issues, but if you route it through the cutout in the back of the stand, the wire bends quite a bit which could lead to it stop working and prevents the phone from sitting well on the stand.  If you don't plan on keeping your phone on the stand while charging this is a great product, but otherwise im not so sure***Really nice, sturdy little stand, with not a great, but a decent enough finish. It holds my phone and my Kindle perfectly, and I think it should manage the average tablet too. The rubber pads are very useful for stabilising the phone. The only con is that it isn't adjustable. It holds the phone at the perfect vertical or horizontal angle for while you're sitting upright, but if you're lying down, you may have to wedge some folded paper behind the phone to prop it forward if you want to change the angle. But that's really not a deal breaker for me. It also could have had a little more distance between the phone seat and the base for the charger cord, but again, not a deal breaker. You can charge the phone sideways as well. All in all, perfectly happy with the stand, it's pretty much what I needed.***If you see the below,  you will notice that the power cord has to be twisted. In the long run, the mobile charging slot would spoil.  This would have been a good product in case there would be a little for more space so that no wires are twisted in order to fit properly.  Please increase the height of the product.***Reliable.... exactly what I needed.... quite easy to refer my applications on my cell phone without engaging the hand.... and safe for replying the calls or also a perfect stand/base for my Tab {keeping it horizontally} .... extremely durable.... required only a little space.... stable and very solid.... my bedside or office table essential/must.... marvellous design and finish.... expecting more and a little bigger with same quanlity control from ELV SMART STAND.... 10 OUT OF 10....in respect of the Quality.... design.... look.... price.... uses and all promises in specifications.... Keep it up iSmart and Ofcourse AMAZON as well.... Guys go for it if at all you wish to enjoy longer..... untiring use of your cell phones /tablets....***This cell phone stand is really good as described in the listing. if the manufacturer ELV reads these comments just would like to suggest that increase the height little bit as the stand may not house the phone along with charger properly without bending the wire which in long run will lead to damaged charging cable. Apart from that the stand is of Good Quality***Nice and heavy/solid and sleek looking at just the right angle for desktop viewing/use. I am often on calls and trouble shooting app performance with customers, great to have the phone at my fingertips to use for reference as it charges. I love the size of the charger cord hole, end easily fits through but it's just small enough to not slide easily out when unplugged and drop back behind the desk as they are apt to do.***An awareness steady and firm stand I always wanted to have. Currently I am rocking an awesome OnePlus 5T and used to mount it vertically and trust me its a huge phone (though it has a very good weight distribution) but the way this stand handles it a pro level stuff. I even have snoozed multiple times my alarm while half asleep in the morning but to my surprise I found my phone steady and firmly sitting whiere I left it IN VERTICAL orientation and that's totally unexpected from a stand this small. I liked it so much that I ordered a second one for my wife very next day. Hats off to the manufacturer for the hardwork and dedicated efforts put together to make this product and A warm Thanks to Amazon for providing a marketplace for both of us.***"

Also, don’t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says “Pairing mode”.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn’t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone’s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth’s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don’t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of ₹1499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***"

Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand👌👌Picture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.👍I saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***"

"Tech Sense Lab Car Mobile Phone Holder(2018) with One Touch 360 Degree Rotating for Dashboard/Windshield, for all Smartphones(Black)",Tech Sense Lab,https://www.amazon.in/Tech-Sense-Lab-Windshield-Smartphones/dp/B074CWYNVP/ref=sr_1_378?keywords=phone&qid=1563167952&s=electronics&sr=1-378,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sRT-IQcrL._SL1000_.jpg,,3.3 out of 5 stars,477 customer reviews,48 answered questions,,"Extensively tested in extreme australian conditions - transformer one touch mobile holder, designed in australia, and tested rigorously for months in extreme australian weather. This is our best design for the mobile mount yet and we are confident that this is the only mount you will ever needPrioritise safety while driving - never compromise on your safety, safety of your copassengers and the safety of the people on road. Most people do not use a mobile holder because its too cumbersome or it keeps dropping. Thats why we developed the most advanced, one touch mount system that is easy to operate and secureUniversal compatibility with sturdy and secure mounting: adjustable design expands to fit almost any phone (2.1 to 3.3 inches wide) with powerful grip keeping your mobile securely fixed throughout your drive. Transformer mobile holder comes with extendable and adjustable telescopic arm which swivels in a 260arc. The highly-flexible ball-joint provides infinite viewing angles for a convenient viewing angleExtreme silicon gel suction: suction cup with integrated adhesive gel pad stays firmly fixed in place even in extreme temperatures, sticks securely to most surfaces (including textured surfaces), yet is still easily removable. Also reusable (infinite times) as it restores to actual mint condition after rinsing with water and air dryingIndustry leading 12 months warranty and peace of mind","Writing a review after just a day of receiving and installing it.Overall, very happy with the product.Build quality:- The build quality looks pretty decent out of the box - the phone stays pretty firm in the moving car as well.- The sticky suction cup also does a good job - but only on Glass surface.- Although, I was not able to get this stuck on a textured dashboard (which i think is the case with most cars) - The company claims that it stick on textured surface as well - so maybe i am doing something wrong. I did try the 2nd lock position - but it came out anyways.- Will try and update the review for the suction when the window-glass is under hot / cold conditionsFunctional Review:- This is one of the best car holders i have come across.- While you can adjust the angle by one arm, you also can extend another arm. This extension arm is quite handy especially if your actual stick-point is a little far out.- The phone holding/locking mechanism is also impressive. Just push the phone to the back surface and it will auto lock it into position with its mechanism. Taking the phone out is also equally simple without the phone slipping out.- the phone holder is again 360 degree rotatable. So irrespective of where you mount the holder, with the 2 arms and holder mechanism, you will easily be able to keep the phone in just the right angle that you want.Its certainly an expensive product when you compare it with most other decent ones coming at half the price. But i believe its worth the extra money. Also in my view, if this proves to be good build quality over time, it is only a one time investment at least for a couple of years.Having seen a lot of people being ignorant about talking on phone while driving, i would urge every one to please avoid using phones completely while driving and for important calls and navigation, use blue-tooth headphones / speaker-phone in combination with a car phone holder.DRIVE SAFE !***The product is highly useful. Most of the cellphones can be easily held by it. It sticks firmly with the front glass of the car, can be removed easily  and Anotherproduct from Tech sense.Pros:The build quality is sturdy.It can easily hold wide variety of different mobiles.Easy to install, remove and reuse.ConsNone so far.Happy with this purchase.***Have tried it first time today and looks good so far. Build quality appears sturdy and looks like the manufacturers knew what they were doing. Would have given it 5 stars but once installed, the adjustments are bit tricky (perhaps because of the robustness but well, given the price, we expect more).Though I have separately provided ""packaging feedback"" to Amazon, wanted to mention here as well (as it may be a problem with the original product packaging as well) that the package was in poor shape when it arrived (the inner carton was crushed out of shape and was actually open within in the outer wrapper). The clear plastic sheet which is supposed to protect the adhesive surface until use was not attached. There was no instruction sheet. In spite of all these disappointments, when I assembled the unit and used it, it was a pleasant surprise especially because the suction/adhesive pad worked like a charm on the grainy surface of my car dashboard. So, I decided to keep it. Tech Sense have got this product bang on but packaging is poor.In any case the best car mobile mount I used so far. Hope it stands the test of time. Good job with the product, Tech Sense!***I earlier reviewed the product with 5 star rating. However, after 1 month of usage it started falling frequently. If the car is parked in hot environment it will fall off by itself. I previously reviewed that this product is better than zaap . Now I change my opinion. Those who want long lasting car mobile holder go for zaap. I have a zaap holder which I bought 2 years back and it’s still adhering very strongly. Hence my suggestion is pay little more extra and go for zaap, rather than this one. My tech sense mobile holder is useless now. The warranty of this product is just a gimmick. The company stops responding to emails regarding defective product, making you to suffer for your purchase. I dont recommend this product any more***Product looks sturdy. I am using 2 . One in my wife's car on windscreen and other in my car on dashboard since last 3 days.....Intact.Reduced one star since they have phone holding piece at center of holder bottom, which obstructs with charging cable and make phone tilt a bit while charging.***Amazing product but my IPhone has a battery case so it does not fit that perfectly maybe you can improve on itBut the delivery from Amazon was poor it got delayed multiple times they provided incorrect times of delivery and the. Finally it arrived on Sunday  when they sent a message it would be delivered on a working day***The mount is really flexible enough to find a suitable position to fix the phone either on the dashboard or the windscreen.  My car's dashboard is a little grainy but still it seems to stick on it. I am yet to test the hold by going over a really bad patch of road. One issue I found is that the two clips on the mount which latches on to the phone is sometimes pinching on the volume rockers of my phone (moto g4). I don't use any case or cover for the phone. So when I place the phone on to the mount and the latches lock on to the sides my volume is either reduced to nil or full based on the direction in which you place the phone (upside down or straight). Another issue is, if I place the phone straight up then the bottom clip hinders with the charging port. So I cannot keep the phone vertical on the mount and connect the charger cable. Resolution keep the phone upside down and wait for the screen to rotate itself 180 degrees.***This is a great product, very simple to use and it fits a variety of phones from Iphone SE to Google Pixel. Easy to mount and remove and you can use it by mounting it in any direction. You can quickly mount the phone by Quick Trigger button and also by release button the phone can be removed quickly.Good Product, fully satisfied.***"

But when I tried it.. it was wrong.. and wonderful thing is, it's WiFi SSID was named SHANNU REABEL... How this is possible. Very badly disappointed. I requested for replacement. But worst performance by Amazon***This is a followup of my earlier reviewCurrently immensely regretting my decision to buy this item. The item has already been changed 3 times and it's yet to complete even 1 year. Apart from the 1st time , which I had a replacement with in the 1st week of purchase, every time got a refurbished product from TPlink service center and developed some form of trouble within few weeks.It's ""broken"" again, and I'll go to their store for the 4th time. It's pros remained the same as mentioned in my earlier review (please refer below) but frequent disruption makes it completely a lost case.I'll strongly suggest not to buy this item even if it available at dirty cheap price. I've read multiple reviews mentioning experiences from other buyers. You can read it too.==========================================================Initial review #Feb'18Purchased this item after extensive research (both Offline and Online). The following is a summarized review after almost 1 month of extensive usagePros:Simple no frill designDual antenna configurationExcellent range. (Placed it at ground floor and getting excellent strength in the 1st floor)Simple setup procedure with all required features (which should be suffice for home or SOHO users)Cons:* None till nowWhy 4 Star and not 51. The first item delivered to me was defective (but got replaced seamlessly, thanks to Amazon)Defect was extremely low speed in PC although wireless speed was fine. In case you face the same get it replaced.2. it's too early to comment, if it really works for 12-15 more months; I'll come back and give it a 5 star* I come from Network/Systems background and having extensive exposure to the field of Wired/Wireless networking; hence can confirm this is an excellent item in sub 1K price range.***This is an awesome router which also supports Android mobile application. Basically you can control your router by using your Android smartphone. You just have to do is download an app called THETER and you have to install it. You can get it from Android market I mean in the Android App Store basically you can block other users from accessing the Internet or else you can simply just keep using your Internet and can manage the password and SSID but just by yourself with simple clicks.Thank You***1. Signal Strength : 9/10""The signal strength is good, slightly higher than other routers. My broadband speed is 50 Mbps and over wireless I can get almost 40 to 45 Mbps.""2. Other Features : 10/10""Most special thing about this is that it has an app from which you can manage each and every basic settings of your router. Guest Network is also available.""3. Easy to use : 10/10""In market TP-Link routers are the easiest routers to use & setup. Connect all wires and go to <tplinkwifi.net> then you'll get the setup page by entering the admin username & password, after that modifying the settings is very easy.""4. Durability : 6/10""The white part or you'll call the main body is made of plastic which has small vents for air flow & it router doesn't heat up too much. The long black antennas are slight delicate but it does a great job.***It can't even cover 500squarefeet Area :/It's not good router :/ lot of packet lossIt can't cover your small house too :/Totally disappointed :|Using from six months :/ not even getting range in another rooms(Our flat is 500squarefeet)***The product has stopped working only after 6 months. When taken to Tp Link service centre, they said the number on the box has been scratched and it is not genuine. I want to know what step can amazon take on this instance as i cant get my router repaired and the return policy was just 1 day after purchase.***Okay to start the review, I have been using Netgear N150 router for last 4 years and this time I needed a new router since devices were increasing in my house (Google chromecast, Google Home, Laptops and mobiles). My netgear router was not able to cover even a 2-BHK and when a lot of devices were connecting at the same time, the chromecast and google home stops working which was such a pain when one person wants to listen music or to steam videos on TV.So, I finally decided and after reading a lot of reviews of different products zeroed on to this product - TP-LINK TL-WR940N Wireless-N450 Home Router (Mentioning full name since it seems amazon mixes all the reviews of different products of one brand into one list).Pros -1- The wifi range is good and comfortably covers my 2 BHK house, even after going some more distance away from home(around 20 meters) I get the range.2- Able to connect multiple devices (MIMO tech works) (including chromecast, google home) without interruptions.3- Can easily use this router as wifi range extender as well. A big plus for big homes.4- T Plink app works fine with the router and you can easily customize settings there.5- A RJ-45 cable comes inside the box, helps connecting my ACT broadband connection to laptop when there is no power.Cons-1. I got used to mutiple lights on my Netgear router, but his one has just single light. Turns blue if wifi connection is working fine and turns yellow if ISP connections breaks. Not a big concern. Just need to get used to it.***"

Those days have gone when there were no alternatives to traditional landline phones. But, in today's scenario the technology has advanced so much that companies are coming up with different different mediums of communication. The popularity of cell phones, VoIP, video chatting and many more is increasing day by day. But, there are still many people who love to install those old-fashioned yet easy to use landline phones. Yes, here we are talking about the traditional landline phones but with the increase in the technology the companies are manufacturing a vast number of phones which contains very many new and awe-inspiring features, designs and colors. Thus to satisfy the customers Panasonic which is a renowned name in the field of the electronic gadgets has jumped into this race and produced a new and wide range of landline phones. Panasonic KX-TSC62 SXB Corded Phone White is a landline phone which is amongst them. This phone is stupendously within your means. Apart from this it is also assembled with an alphanumeric display type marvelous feature. At the top of it this phone is completely easy to install and use. Design Coming towards the design of this Panasonic KX-TSC62 SXB Corded Phone White! This phone is wrapped in a black chassis thus it looks decent yet elegant. This is a gorgeous invention from the house of the Panasonic. Along with this awesome device comes with30 caller ID memory. You can see the name and contact number of the caller if his/her contact is saved in your landline phone. Apart from all these functionalities there are some more which are speaker, speaker volume buttons to increase or decrease the volume, flash and redial button to dial the last called number.",Colour : WhiteSlim design with LCD displayThis phone is wrapped in a black chassis thus it looks decent yet elegant,"The phone is not meant for parallel connection, which is an important information that the seller should have mentioned it in product description. The manufacturer clearly printed this information on the box itself and yet a buyer will come to know it only after receiving the product. I tend to believe that this critical  information is hidden by the seller with a purpose as there is no option for refund against return.***It's  one of the good land-phone whose price less than 900. It's sound quality is good, speaker is decent. Definitely you wont get conference facility but rest of the things are above average. One negative point - displaying of caller details in display bar is not consistent. Let me explain this. Say at 8 AM you called person A. At 8:30 you got a call from person B. 9 AM you got another call from C. When you have tried to retrieve the number by presssing down button in caller ID first you should see C, then B and then A. But this order is not maintained..***I have been using Panasonic and Sony desk phones since over 28 yrs.  The first one of Panasonic Speaker and cordless is still working great.  Great Bell, Great adaptor (still running on original), Great Key Pad, Great Speech and volume, Great features ONLY the Battery for cordless unit is no longer available, and if it is, it is priced absurdly.  I have made one by modifying back home, and it has a distortion free range of over 100 ft within the home and across two floors.  This is also a Panasonic, BUT looking at the quality of phones in the past one decade, I am not sure if this Panasonic would live to the expectations.  Some times, I feel, that any other Indian brand may perform just as good or as unpredictable, though the failure rate in Indian devices is still much higher as quality assurance is not primary, nor is customer protection as good.  On such occasions, a brand that has lived over decades would best be the risk.So much is clear, if it is Panasonic or Sony, it must be Japanese, else you cant be assured of quality and its life expectancy.The speech of this device is JUST Average.  The Bell is reasonable for quiet homes to reach two rooms away.  The LCD is too weak to be able to see. The features are not of much use at least to me.  For its performance, it may not be worth more than INR 600, but only because it is Panasonic, one hopes to see its life across at least 10 yrs and that is a big doubt, hence, only 4 star for durability, but three for performance overall.I may be demanding quality for my money, but if my standards to accept rubbish were a routine, I would have rated way above 3 star.Any one reading this review till this line, may read all reviews and take a call.  If it sells less than 900, it is worth the risk, only because it Panasonic, as the failure rates are very low due reasonably good quality assurance.***The LED light on the phone doesn't glow at all. Friends, don't buy this phone. Apart from LED display with no lights and small display, the speaker volume when on WebEx calls is way too feeble to hear. Damn the seller! I initially thought it was just a faulty product when LED lights didn't glow, replaced it, got another one with the same fault. It is the inbuilt defect on this model.***There s no light so it becomes very difficult to look at numbers infact we don't even look at numbers because the effort is too big as even the screen of caller id is too small. Hence,it doesn't even support the purpose of caller id.***It’s a value for money. I have one at my home and I ordered the same at my office. Works flawlessly. The ringtone is loud enough to shock you if you’re sitting right next to it. And the caller ID works too. Really good phone!***looks sleek with an attractive finish, speaker quality is good with volume adjustment as required.registers caller numbers so easy to capture and redial.key buttons are a good size and work wellhowever doesn't  have  dialed number storage beyond last number dialed, wish they had provided 5 important numbers in storage memory***Product seems robust but ring tone is single and should have the provision to increase volume further. At this cost, should have recieved some features like multiple ring tone options to choose from, back light and ringer volume to be higher than the max given now, should have been good.***"

Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps.

I'm used to  7 days***Worst camera ever..pictures look like taken by 2 MP camera***Well where do I start from.  For 15k this is a great phone. I bought it for my dad. I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

Also, don’t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says “Pairing mode”.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn’t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone’s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth’s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don’t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of ₹1499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***"

Poco F1, Honor play, Zenfone 5z and OnePlus 6. These are my shortlists and I first removed op6 because I personally didn't like oneplus because of its overrated specs and camera. SD845 is capable of AI but there is no single feature (thati know of) that used AI in oxygen OS. Then I started reading the official forums of these 3 phones. In Zenfone 5z forums, there are so many people complaining of its bugs and slow updates fixing those bugs. So I removed it next. Then I started thinking extensively on what to buy in between poco F1 and Honor play.I started reading Honor play forums first. In all reviews there, I see people are very satisfied with this and there are very very few complaints in the forumsR (may be a in 20). But I am inclined towards towards sd845 of poco. So, I started reading it's forums and there, I have observed so many people complaining of its build quality and display. I am still convinced some how to compromise on these two. And thought of buying it only because of sd845. I kept on reading the forums day to day. And the complaints in the poco forums kept on increasing related to its display. I have seen one complaint related to screen bleeding in poco for which the company said it is a software issue. I didn't understand how far it is true. What I wanted is not give discouraged after investing 20K of my money. So finally I took the call and ordered HONOR PLAY. I believed in the public forums but not YouTube reviews. The forums will never give wrong data as far as I believe.5 star for the delivery. I got the order delivered on the very next day. Thanks to Amazon. Now coming to mobile,Believe me guys, this is a beast. U will never feel bad for investing ur hard earned 18k on this phone.1) the build quality is excellent. It feels very premium in hand.2) camera is awesome. The pics that I take from this phone really comes very very gud. U can follow me at @praveen_buddhavarapu in Instagram to see some samples of this camera. U won't believe me if I say the night mode is also very Gud. The entire YouTube has completely gone angry with the nightmode of this phone. But believe me guys this phone's camera is no where less to any flagship camera even in night mode.3) the gallery app. This is the most lovely thing in this phone. I have been wondering how apple used face recognition and sorts photos based on faces, places and things. The same is also being done by Honor in this phone. The gallery app sorts and orders the pics based on the location, faces, things. And the next best thing is, it creates videos of the people like how apple does in iOS gallery app.4) Histen audio feature. If u wear earphones and listen to some FLAC songs with full volume with the Histen sound mode set to auto, trust me u will feel very much involved in the song and u can definitely forget about the sorroundings (use it at high volume only in ur personal place, but please keep track of us sorroundings in public places)4) Display is awesome. I have used a mobile with amoled display previously and I use to feel very indulged when I watch HD videos in it. The fhd display in Honor play is no where inferior to the amoled display and u can find no difference at all in between the two displays.5) the massive 3750 mah battery is a great thing in this phone. I don't use dual sim though my previous phones have dual sim support. I always use only one Airtel sim. With single sim, the battery use to stand for 1 and half day completely with normal usage. Always internet was on and screen on time is around 2-3hrs in an average.6) EMUI is perfectly blended. No bugs umi identified in my personal usage except one personal suggestion. That is they have to implement the iPhone X kind of gestures as soon as possible in this. Because when we type something, the on screen home button comes exactly down the space button and in speed typing, I sometimes use to hit on the home button instead of space. So this is the only problem is faced in this. Though Honor has confirmed the iPhone X style of gestures in Pie update, I am eagerly waiting for it.7) the notification led is placed at the correct position inside the earpiece. I think all the phones should place the led inside the earpiece as it won't take any extra place there. I tested it with blue, white, orange, green  olkurs. But I think it will glow in some other colours as well.8) lastly the performance, man this is a beast. I can't say anything more. I have been using this for past one month and I never faced single hiccup with this phone. like the phone was branded, it is very smooth a gaming. I play pubg atleast 3-4 full games per day (mean 1-2 hrs daily) and I never faced any issue like lag or frame drop with this phone. The gaming suite is awesome. It won't show the annoying notifications as notification heads when we are playing any games.Finally I can say that this is a phone worth its price and worth my time I spent looking at reviews for this. I first feared that, after buying this phone, i might get a feeling that I didn't buy poco or Zenfone. But I never got such a feelong while using this. I am very much satisfied with this mobile and i'm happy that I didn't buy POCO. I don't know how many issues that I would face if I had bought poco.Hope this review helps u to decide on ur phone. Please let me know if u have any questions related to this phone. I am happy to answer.***I purchased the mobile on last week of October. Everything was fine. The performance was outstanding. The build quality was super, but yesterday my phone explode. Now I know how they implement flagship processor at such a low price tag. I don't think that they use a good quality battery.Thankfully I didn't get injuries.I don't recomend this phone to buy. Please guys stay away from this phone . Please don't buy this. And those who already purchased this please use this device carefully.***Finally after one month i am writing my experience about honor play 6 GB varient. it is a good phone with good visual display. i was very confused before buying this product because of so called mobile experts on youtube some youtubers claim that camera is just OK and struggle in low light and BLA BLA but finally i bought this on my own risk and i am happy to buy it.1) Camera quality is good and it takes very sharp pictures but those who are expecting DSLR quality please don't buy it  because it is a phone which contains camera feature, if you are fond of photography then please buy a DSLR and  don't buy any phone for that.  People take selfie/ backshot and zoom it and i don't know why they do so and finally complain some noise and all  that stuff. Well this phone doesn't contain any professional lance but its camera capture good pictures in low light  too. 2) Battery backup is fabulous i am getting 3-4 battery backup by using its unique feature ultra battery saving mode.  if you are not a phone worm then you may get 3 days battery backup easily. I always put my phone on ultra battery  saving mode specially in night and when i don't use my phone.3) Gaming is also good on this phone however, i didn't play much because i play game on my PC rather phone but i  don't see any lag while playing asphalt 8.4) Build quality is solid and it feels like a premium device. i have bought a 6 GB blue color variant which looks great.5) i recommend to buy if you are not so much ambitious regarding phones.6) Yes it heats up easily while gaming and it is annoying in summer but gamers can ignore this issue.***Expected better camera performance, expected kirin 970 to be killer in gaming performance but its not upto the mark. can not compare kirin 970 to snapdragon 845 or 835, but i guess at this price point its a good phone. could get better performance with the POCOFONE. No complaints with Look of the phone, it looks beautiful***Build quality nd design best You feel a premium phone in your hand👌👌Picture quality is good only in daylight in night it struggles alot. I'm not telling that it has a worst camera for night. Compare to other device at this price range they have good one .. bt it ok for night too if you not a camera centric personGaming is best in this phone thanks to Kirin 970  nd GPU trubo . You can play pubg in HD mode without any lag .. while playing pubg for 30 min it gets little warm that's nt an issue. If you are a pubg lover go for it.👍I saw some YouTube review of this phone some tech gurus complaining about sound quality and low volume don't listen to them , sound quality is best and high volume is sufficient.Battery life go for a whole day if you play game for one hour .. if you don't.. it last for one and half day.Conclusion .. this the best phone under 20k i got it at 17k***"

This is our best design for the mobile mount yet and we are confident that this is the only mount you will ever needPrioritise safety while driving - never compromise on your safety, safety of your copassengers and the safety of the people on road. Most people do not use a mobile holder because its too cumbersome or it keeps dropping. Thats why we developed the most advanced, one touch mount system that is easy to operate and secureUniversal compatibility with sturdy and secure mounting: adjustable design expands to fit almost any phone (2.1 to 3.3 inches wide) with powerful grip keeping your mobile securely fixed throughout your drive.

The highly-flexible ball-joint provides infinite viewing angles for a convenient viewing angleExtreme silicon gel suction: suction cup with integrated adhesive gel pad stays firmly fixed in place even in extreme temperatures, sticks securely to most surfaces (including textured surfaces), yet is still easily removable. Also reusable (infinite times) as it restores to actual mint condition after rinsing with water and air dryingIndustry leading 12 months warranty and peace of mind","Writing a review after just a day of receiving and installing it.Overall, very happy with the product.Build quality:- The build quality looks pretty decent out of the box - the phone stays pretty firm in the moving car as well.- The sticky suction cup also does a good job - but only on Glass surface.- Although, I was not able to get this stuck on a textured dashboard (which i think is the case with most cars) - The company claims that it stick on textured surface as well - so maybe i am doing something wrong. I did try the 2nd lock position - but it came out anyways.- Will try and update the review for the suction when the window-glass is under hot / cold conditionsFunctional Review:- This is one of the best car holders i have come across.- While you can adjust the angle by one arm, you also can extend another arm. This extension arm is quite handy especially if your actual stick-point is a little far out.- The phone holding/locking mechanism is also impressive. Just push the phone to the back surface and it will auto lock it into position with its mechanism. Taking the phone out is also equally simple without the phone slipping out.- the phone holder is again 360 degree rotatable. So irrespective of where you mount the holder, with the 2 arms and holder mechanism, you will easily be able to keep the phone in just the right angle that you want.Its certainly an expensive product when you compare it with most other decent ones coming at half the price. But i believe its worth the extra money. Also in my view, if this proves to be good build quality over time, it is only a one time investment at least for a couple of years.Having seen a lot of people being ignorant about talking on phone while driving, i would urge every one to please avoid using phones completely while driving and for important calls and navigation, use blue-tooth headphones / speaker-phone in combination with a car phone holder.DRIVE SAFE !***The product is highly useful. Most of the cellphones can be easily held by it. It sticks firmly with the front glass of the car, can be removed easily  and Anotherproduct from Tech sense.Pros:The build quality is sturdy.It can easily hold wide variety of different mobiles.Easy to install, remove and reuse.ConsNone so far.Happy with this purchase.***Have tried it first time today and looks good so far. Build quality appears sturdy and looks like the manufacturers knew what they were doing. Would have given it 5 stars but once installed, the adjustments are bit tricky (perhaps because of the robustness but well, given the price, we expect more).Though I have separately provided ""packaging feedback"" to Amazon, wanted to mention here as well (as it may be a problem with the original product packaging as well) that the package was in poor shape when it arrived (the inner carton was crushed out of shape and was actually open within in the outer wrapper). The clear plastic sheet which is supposed to protect the adhesive surface until use was not attached. There was no instruction sheet. In spite of all these disappointments, when I assembled the unit and used it, it was a pleasant surprise especially because the suction/adhesive pad worked like a charm on the grainy surface of my car dashboard. So, I decided to keep it. Tech Sense have got this product bang on but packaging is poor.In any case the best car mobile mount I used so far. Hope it stands the test of time. Good job with the product, Tech Sense!***I earlier reviewed the product with 5 star rating. However, after 1 month of usage it started falling frequently. If the car is parked in hot environment it will fall off by itself. I previously reviewed that this product is better than zaap . Now I change my opinion. Those who want long lasting car mobile holder go for zaap. I have a zaap holder which I bought 2 years back and it’s still adhering very strongly. Hence my suggestion is pay little more extra and go for zaap, rather than this one. My tech sense mobile holder is useless now. The warranty of this product is just a gimmick. The company stops responding to emails regarding defective product, making you to suffer for your purchase. I dont recommend this product any more***Product looks sturdy. I am using 2 . One in my wife's car on windscreen and other in my car on dashboard since last 3 days.....Intact.Reduced one star since they have phone holding piece at center of holder bottom, which obstructs with charging cable and make phone tilt a bit while charging.***Amazing product but my IPhone has a battery case so it does not fit that perfectly maybe you can improve on itBut the delivery from Amazon was poor it got delayed multiple times they provided incorrect times of delivery and the. Finally it arrived on Sunday  when they sent a message it would be delivered on a working day***The mount is really flexible enough to find a suitable position to fix the phone either on the dashboard or the windscreen.  My car's dashboard is a little grainy but still it seems to stick on it. I am yet to test the hold by going over a really bad patch of road. One issue I found is that the two clips on the mount which latches on to the phone is sometimes pinching on the volume rockers of my phone (moto g4). I don't use any case or cover for the phone. So when I place the phone on to the mount and the latches lock on to the sides my volume is either reduced to nil or full based on the direction in which you place the phone (upside down or straight). Another issue is, if I place the phone straight up then the bottom clip hinders with the charging port. So I cannot keep the phone vertical on the mount and connect the charger cable. Resolution keep the phone upside down and wait for the screen to rotate itself 180 degrees.***This is a great product, very simple to use and it fits a variety of phones from Iphone SE to Google Pixel. Easy to mount and remove and you can use it by mounting it in any direction. You can quickly mount the phone by Quick Trigger button and also by release button the phone can be removed quickly.Good Product, fully satisfied.***"

But when I tried it.. it was wrong.. and wonderful thing is, it's WiFi SSID was named SHANNU REABEL... How this is possible. Very badly disappointed. I requested for replacement. But worst performance by Amazon***This is a followup of my earlier reviewCurrently immensely regretting my decision to buy this item. The item has already been changed 3 times and it's yet to complete even 1 year. Apart from the 1st time , which I had a replacement with in the 1st week of purchase, every time got a refurbished product from TPlink service center and developed some form of trouble within few weeks.It's ""broken"" again, and I'll go to their store for the 4th time. It's pros remained the same as mentioned in my earlier review (please refer below) but frequent disruption makes it completely a lost case.I'll strongly suggest not to buy this item even if it available at dirty cheap price. I've read multiple reviews mentioning experiences from other buyers. You can read it too.==========================================================Initial review #Feb'18Purchased this item after extensive research (both Offline and Online). The following is a summarized review after almost 1 month of extensive usagePros:Simple no frill designDual antenna configurationExcellent range. (Placed it at ground floor and getting excellent strength in the 1st floor)Simple setup procedure with all required features (which should be suffice for home or SOHO users)Cons:* None till nowWhy 4 Star and not 51. The first item delivered to me was defective (but got replaced seamlessly, thanks to Amazon)Defect was extremely low speed in PC although wireless speed was fine. In case you face the same get it replaced.2. it's too early to comment, if it really works for 12-15 more months; I'll come back and give it a 5 star* I come from Network/Systems background and having extensive exposure to the field of Wired/Wireless networking; hence can confirm this is an excellent item in sub 1K price range.***This is an awesome router which also supports Android mobile application. Basically you can control your router by using your Android smartphone. You just have to do is download an app called THETER and you have to install it. You can get it from Android market I mean in the Android App Store basically you can block other users from accessing the Internet or else you can simply just keep using your Internet and can manage the password and SSID but just by yourself with simple clicks.Thank You***1. Signal Strength : 9/10""The signal strength is good, slightly higher than other routers. My broadband speed is 50 Mbps and over wireless I can get almost 40 to 45 Mbps.""2. Other Features : 10/10""Most special thing about this is that it has an app from which you can manage each and every basic settings of your router. Guest Network is also available.""3. Easy to use : 10/10""In market TP-Link routers are the easiest routers to use & setup. Connect all wires and go to <tplinkwifi.net> then you'll get the setup page by entering the admin username & password, after that modifying the settings is very easy.""4. Durability : 6/10""The white part or you'll call the main body is made of plastic which has small vents for air flow & it router doesn't heat up too much. The long black antennas are slight delicate but it does a great job.***It can't even cover 500squarefeet Area :/It's not good router :/ lot of packet lossIt can't cover your small house too :/Totally disappointed :|Using from six months :/ not even getting range in another rooms(Our flat is 500squarefeet)***The product has stopped working only after 6 months. When taken to Tp Link service centre, they said the number on the box has been scratched and it is not genuine. I want to know what step can amazon take on this instance as i cant get my router repaired and the return policy was just 1 day after purchase.***Okay to start the review, I have been using Netgear N150 router for last 4 years and this time I needed a new router since devices were increasing in my house (Google chromecast, Google Home, Laptops and mobiles). My netgear router was not able to cover even a 2-BHK and when a lot of devices were connecting at the same time, the chromecast and google home stops working which was such a pain when one person wants to listen music or to steam videos on TV.So, I finally decided and after reading a lot of reviews of different products zeroed on to this product - TP-LINK TL-WR940N Wireless-N450 Home Router (Mentioning full name since it seems amazon mixes all the reviews of different products of one brand into one list).Pros -1- The wifi range is good and comfortably covers my 2 BHK house, even after going some more distance away from home(around 20 meters) I get the range.2- Able to connect multiple devices (MIMO tech works) (including chromecast, google home) without interruptions.3- Can easily use this router as wifi range extender as well. A big plus for big homes.4- T Plink app works fine with the router and you can easily customize settings there.5- A RJ-45 cable comes inside the box, helps connecting my ACT broadband connection to laptop when there is no power.Cons-1. I got used to mutiple lights on my Netgear router, but his one has just single light. Turns blue if wifi connection is working fine and turns yellow if ISP connections breaks. Not a big concern. Just need to get used to it.***"

Yes, i just used this phone for 4 days and sold in olx for 12500/-.got it for 14034/- post cash back .  Overall the phone is excellent. but the photographer in me who got used to capture stunning pics in oneplus 3t, its not all satisfactory.  the portrait mode is worst.  although the display is good, there is slight lag when you are switching between apps.

I am very satisfied with the phone. Honor have started making very nice n premium phone on low budget. I had also bought real me pro2 from flipkart for my sis. I compared both I must tell u go for honor 8x, real me pro2 doesn't have portrait mode or bokeh mode on front camera.. display is bigger then real me pro2, this is the only difference otherwise both phones are alike. If u ask me then I will prefer honor 8x***Better than Mi note 5pro or A,10/10 design10/10 camera10/10 battery10/10 performanceIf it comes with earphone and little long usb cable than customer will be more happy***This is amazing powerful and beautiful fon from honor best camera, battery, design, display, sound quality, processor***I was previously using Lenovo Z2 plus and it was one of the best phones in 2017 offering snapdragon 820 at just RS. 10,000. So after a year it started lagging cuz I was playing very heavy games. So then the new Mid Range phones were Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X. These were under by budget. I wanted to buy Realme 2 Pro as it had 8gb ram and good camera. But then after watching a lot of youtube videos, I thought I should go for honor 8x. And so I bought this. When I opened the package and took honor 8x on my hand, it felt premium. But then when I started downloading apps from playstore, it wasn't using my data to download it, just wifi. I had to cancel all installs and download it at my office Wifi. 2)The next thing is that, the phone is really really HEAVY. I was using it with my left hand while I was sleeping, and literally after 5 minutes my wrist started to pain. But what if it falls on my head or mouth, like all the phones do? While using it lying on the bed? I am going to get a serious injury. In the Tech pages too, they have mentioned this as a Con.3)Front Camera:  The Camera really SUCKs. The back camera is okay, but it's saturation is very high especially for Red, Green and Blue. The camera has depth, but it's of no use as the Camera Saturation is high. Don't talk about the front camera, I use my sister's Realme 1 for taking selfies...4) PUBG: So when I open the game, it has loading error, says 'Could not connect to server' seems to be network issue, but the Realme 1 loads properly without any issues, even when both the phones are in the SAME room. Also the map in Realme 1 loads faster, maybe because it has 6 GB ram and the one I am using has 4 GB. I should have gone for Realme 2 pro which had 6 Gb for lesser Price.I wished I had ordered Realme 2 pro. Too lazy to return then get refund and all. But if you need a light phone, go for Realme 2 pro. it's light, games don't lag and also has a good battery. I'm just somewhat sad.  And the Customer Service of HONOR is so pathetic, they don't know what I am asking and COPY PASTE wrong info in the chat, I once had to talk with a Supervisor to get the correct information.***"

This is the worst drawback of the instrument.Secondly the company has given around 8-9 options of ringtones but barely 2 or 3 are the appealing ones and others can not be distinguished. Thirdly i found the speaker volume [the sound / call volume of person on the other side] also a bit low***Nice device... Just received on 6th Feb. I would have given 4 stars if the speaker phone might work properly. Some sound due to echo is observed every time I try to talk over hands free mode.. Made in China by the way. Don,'t know till what time it will be functioning properly.. one can buy it if required in office.***Best match for my personal use in office. There was no ringing issue occurred once but resolved automatically!! I don't know how did it happened. But it wasn't happened again. That's why I have given it 4 star!! Otherwise I'd give it 5...***The person on the other side couldn't hear clearly if speaker mode is enabled. Mic is not sensitive enough to catch sounds originating from more than 0.5 feet away. All other features are as described in spec.***Initially it worked well. But in a span of just 4 months instrument give problem. People cannot hear at the other end.***Okay***Good quality landline phone***Decent phone. Supports CLI. Finish is average not great.***"

Front camera pictures very poor. Battery is very good . Pure android experience very good. Phone is awesome but only camera is negative point. I'm Very disappointed with this .***Previously I was using Mi 5 mobile. Compared to that the features are less in BlackBerry Evolve.Battery is so awesome. It gets quickly charged and has two modes of charging (normal and quick modes). Battery stands for two days with the use of 4 hours of net surfing each day in 4G mode.Camera features and picture quality are admirable. Though Dolby Atmos is featured in Evolve X, the sound quality of Evolve with Dolby Digital too is so good.Except DTEK, the BlackBerry security software, I expected much more from BlackBerry though I was not completely satisfied with the present state of the software components of the mobile. Hope, BlackBerry would come up with necessary updates through their R & D to redeem their lost glory in mobile market.***Posting review after 12+ days of usage:Heating & slow charging issue, hang issue, Camera issue & many more..Blackberry evolve- its a total waste of money..So plzz its a humble request to all of You not to buy such type of this phones. There many phones available in the markets with such great specs.Ideally I requested a refund because such issues are never expected from a premium brand premium handset!Now if the replacement handset is also having the issues than only I'll get a refund.***Mobile looks and packing is awesome. Battery and quick charging good big display.But camera is very low quality for this price. I expect more. But this price is for not mobile. Only brand price. Not worth. Dont buy this mobile brothers. I want to return that mobile but the seller is telling no return and refund. Only replacement. Thats not good quality.***HiAfter using the handset extensively for last 24 hours I decided to write the review.. to start with evolve built quality and finishing looks premium..being an avid photographer first thing which I tried was clicking some pictures &trust me it didn't disappoint me. images clicked in low light were also decent enough.Full marks to blackberry team for camera quality.. battery back up was good enough to last a day...***Worst experience. Amazon is not at all cooperative. The phone has problem with updates and yahoo mail. And more with battery. The Amazon is not willing to to take back the product. I recommend not to buy this product.***Amazon.. Perfect exchange deal! Amazing delivery! Thanks!This phone is a beast! Mind-blowing and awesome phone. Definitely pricing is very low for the phone of this quality. Since people want a high end processor in a high end phone, they are not happy. Otherwise the looks, quality, feel, specs are so nice. I am happy with snapdragon 450 processor since it is not lagging. Battery seems to have decent life. Picture quality with bokeh mode and wide selfie are great. Front and back flash are very helpful. Finger print sensor is working fine ...seems close to one sec but it's OK. Face unlock feature is nice and fast. Dolby digital audio is nice. Phone comes with great quality headset which is awesome. Full HD+ Screen is amazing. Display level is decent. In my opinion it is not like Chinese cheap quality displays which create pain in eyes after prolonged use. Blackberry Hub is a great feature accessing all messengers and social network with in a single app. I don't play games so I expect decent battery life otherwise expect mildly hot battery.***Camera needs improvement.

(i cant comment much on the gaming performance)Read / watched quite a lot of reviews and made my decision over One Plus 6T.Rear Camera :Crisp and clear image and hardly no difference with 1+. 4K videos and full HD videos, background blur in the video, are cool features.Night mode is amazing., better than 1+48MP AI camera is just fine, its not Wow.  You expect a lot more for that number. It matches ip with 1+Slow motion is only @ 720p.. 1+ is better off.Front cam pics are good, but videos are more stable in 1+ as V20 does not have image stabilization for front cam., hope there's a firmware update soon.Too many options available for photos and videos., You need to explore hands on to get the real feel of all the features.Personally i prefer the punch hole over the water drop notch. The screen looks bigger and the notch does not bother much.Needless to say about the design of V20, definitely gives a premium than the 1+Headphone jack, IR sensor, Notification lights are cool features to have (all 3 are missing in 1+)Lcd IPS display in V20 vs Amoled display in the 1+, which means though the battery might look bigger in number on the V20.,  1+ will last a few hours more.. The display in V20 is still good.User interface is better in the 1+ and honor's magic UI is way behind.The silicon back case is perfect.Overall not much of a difference between Honor V20 and 1+6T in terms of performance, display, battery or camera.Its good to hold a top notch, latest phone with first in class latest specs. Go for it. I'm happy with the phone.***It's nor worth for money.. Camera is very normal as 12MP only. Dunno in what basis they are saying it as 48MP. It's not going zoomin dept as oneplus 6T goes. Indoor pics are not that good. Even nyt shoot ll be better in vivo or oppo than this one. If anyone is going to get this mob just for a cam don't buy. It's my suggestion. Battery is gud but not as moto or one plus provides. Display is gud.***this is my initial review will post again after few weeks1) Display (6/10)- yes its a punch hole but panel quality is average2) Selfie camera(6/10) - images are soft when taken indoors.3) Rear Camera (7.5/10) - good photos in good light, hit and a miss affair in an indoor/low light situation.4) Performance (9/10) is very good , no lags.5) There is a vibration felt in the phone when talking to someone, feels hollow inside.6) Sound output via earphones is good but not great7) Speakers are average.30k would have justified the cost for this phone but 38k its not worth.***Honor / Huawei made another gorgeous look handset in 2019.I received the same yesterday, so few points I can elaborate today, but I definitely revise my review soon after a month or two.1. Look is stunning2. Rear Camera is awesome though its hard to understand that what 3D TOF actually is. But 48Megapixels are more than enough, you can ZOOM how much you want but PPI (Pixel per inches) will never fetch3. Front Camera - Same as above, (Do not forget to OFF beauty plus button) front camera is also stunning.4. Turbo/Super charging. I charged it only 20 minutes yesterday and battery goes 5% t0 76%.5. Size is almost same as Honor 9i was. Though molded screen is better than that.6 NO heat till yet, though phone was hot when the delivery agent bring it to me but that because he took the box in sunlight before delivering (In his back pack and he was on two wheeler)7. Sound is good, not too awesome.And You can not add external microphone in honor 20 while recording a video. But in other androids, you can add the same easily.Overall phone is better than Iphone ;) . Revised reviewThanksSiddharth Arora***Used it for more than 2 hours, the display looks great with punch hole technology. Battery life and camera are things which are yet to be tested by me. I will update this review after 2 days of use.So far so good***Better then 6t***Just now i got mobile... Excellent performance,  sounds and camera are awesome. I will post after usage of other spec.***"

For reference, I might add more here that I have used Redmi Note 4 last year and Honor 7x early this year, both were good phones at their prices.I exchanged my Redmi Note 4 against buying Oppo F9 Pro, and got a decent exchange price of Rs.7,100/- (incl. extra Rs.3,000/-), which was a big incentive to go for this also.Now, about the phone Oppo F9 Pro, I am purely delighted. Not only, the camera is good, the overall performance just amazed me. Yes, I am not a much of a gamer, but I load too many apps, and must I say, it works exceptionally well.Although working RAM you get is near about 3 GB only out of 6 GB, but it does the job brilliantly. Not even once it lagged anywhere. It breaks the common myth about the supremacy of snapdragon chips over all else.Oppo F9 Pro has Mediatek chip and its great.The best part is the battery back up. First of all, it charges superfast, its unbelievable. It charged from 20% to 100% within 45 min. I charged it yesterday morning, its 7pm today, and its still got 38% juice left.Thank you Amazon, once again.***Very nice good performance***Phone is not what it describes, expected with 6GB Memory. Games like candy crush and hay days get hanged and while u using any app and get a call there is no way u can receive the call, phone is hung. Worst is it gets heated up.

But still, I upgraded to just because of it's Camera.●The phone is too sleek and gives a premium look (If you don't put cover on it)●There is no joke in terms of dual camera setup what are generally other manufacturers are doing. (Most of the company are providing just 2MP setup in the name of dual camera, which is not too much effective and just for the name of dual camera)●Stock Android is too fast even 3 GB RAM is sufficient for this chipset unless you play games on mobiles.●Enduring Battery Backup is 24-30 hours depending on your usage.●Selfie Camera is class across the all leading mobiles.●Screen & Sound Quality is just average and not so good, If I compare to MiA1● Call Voice clarity and Signal reception is too good just like the Mi A1●And yes you have to compromise with battery backup, Audio Jack and no expandable storage option. There is some sensors issues too what I am noticing (may be resolved in OTA updates)But still, searching a Camera centric phone under 20K with very fast processor with uncustomized Andorid (Stock Andorid) then your search comes to an ends on this device.Go for it surely***Overall rating 3.5/5 cant give 3.5 stars so 3* rating.I bought this in the Amazon sale for 13.5k so for that price its a very competent smartphone but it has some major drawbacks at regular MRP that stops it from being a perfect mid ranger. Drawbacks mentioned under cons.Now you might be thinking by reading the previous statement that aha, we know what they are, but no reader they are not what you think. I am not taking about the missing micro sd slot or headphone jack.Vs Nokia 7 PlusI bought this phone because someone stole my Nokia 7 plus. I had lived with a same spec phone for 5 months and let me tell you the A2 is a way better phone in terms of performance and smoothness. The 7 plus from day 1 always stuttered, froze and had janky animations. Even after multiple updates the 7 plus was not a smooth performer. So performance is a plus. The A2 performs as a SD660 phone should.7 plus had better battery life. Yes 7 plus has a bigger battery but battery drain under load was also less on the 7 plus.Phone supports Quick charge and I have the qc3.0 charger so I can take advantage of fast charging feature. Standard supplied charger is a 10W charger. Even with screen on the fast charging keeps working unlike the 7 Plus and some other phones.Build quality on Nokia 7 plus is better but that also costs more. A2 is well built as well but the Nokia is better. A2 is slippery AF, the back is super smooth.Display is better on A2 since it has no jelly effect(which the Nokia had) and the calibration is a waaaaayyy better compared to Nokia 7 plus  which has an awfully high white point and terrible RBG & grayscale performance. Brightness is about the same.Cons1) A2 has adequate battery life. 5PM topups are required if you use all the features of the phone. This is not an all day phone.2) No widewine L1(has L3) certification means no FHD Netflix and Amazon prime. You are stuck at 480p. This is really bad, my 5 year old Xperia Z3 has Widewine L1. This is just penny pinching where a manufacturer should not penny pinch.3) No LDAC support even though this is an Oreo feature. I tested using Sony wireless headphones which support LDAC.4) Pathetic vibration motor.5) No Hybrid sim slot. For 2 sim users like me this is not a deal breaker since we know what we are getting into but no micro sd slot is a turnoff for many.6) No IP certification. Yes I know its a mid range phone & I'm not expecting IP68 but IP54(Splash proof) IMHO is a must on all phones above 10K.7) Only USB 2.0 support. its 2018 manufacturers 3.0 only cost 15-20 cents more to implement.8) Does not support Pixel camera mod, Nokia 7 plus supported it.Pros:Android OneSnappy performance, its nearly SD835 fast. I tested using PC mark and the Work 2.0 scores are within 10%. My other phone has SD835.QC4.0 support and backwards compatible with all versions of Quick Charge.USB Type C.Above average cameras, competent for the segment.Conclusion:When you buy a smartphone you are looking for the complete experience and this phone does not provide that in a few key areas like the lack of widewine L1 and LDAC support. I have been aware of widewine L1 b4 the pocofone controversy because unlike Netflix, Amazon prime supports only a handful of Samsung, Apple & Sony devices for 1080p & HDR playback and even if your phone has widewine L1 unless the phone is Amazon certified you will not get 1080p playback in the prime video app. So the first thing I tested was the DRM info and this phone lacks widewine L1 which is a bummer.I can understand the lack of aptx since that requires additional royalties to qualcomm and the A2 being a midranger I can see why Xiaomi chose to not provide aptX or aptx HD but no LDAC, come on there is no headphone jack on this device so the least Xiaomi could have done is enable a feature that is baked into the Oreo OS to at least provide the best BT audio codec.Considering the sharp fall is data rates and the rise of streaming video services which a ton of users use its baffling that Xiaomi chose to omit 2 really important features which are so important to really enjoy streaming servicesThis is a phone that has some very strong points like, Android One, fast smooth performance, support for QC4.0 but then has huge drawbacks which I have mentioned previously along with the missing 3.5mm jack and no hybrid slot support.Who should buy the Mi A2: Someone who is looking for a fast snappy performing phone and values stock Android and 2 years of guaranteed updates over features like 3.5mm jack, SD card slot and marathon (7-8 hr SOT) battery run times..***Pros:- all good, big screen, really good camera, looksCons:- the type c connector provided along is not working. I have tried two different brand headphone but the phone is not detecting it so it could be faulty type c connector? Or is it specific to Mi headphones only?? Because under the headphone setting it shows MI headphones option only.Can anyone help?***Awesome productPros:Faster chipsetGood camerasValue for moneyStock Android softwareQuick Charge 4+ supportGood displaysuperb selfie cameraCons:No 3.5mm audio jacklacks a microSD card slotAverage battery lifeMissing NotchThanks Amazon & Faster n Guarantee delivery.***It is an awesome phone..  this is for those who wants a better camera.. it's camera is truly amazing.specially the manual mode.. it's speaker is tooo loud.

Forget about pictures in low light, FYI.Even the selfies are grainy and there's literally no stability at all.Well. Gaming. That's a Big NO. If you play high fps games then this phone isn't for you. It heats up in just two games of War Robots.Multitasking on this phone is great though. Easy to use, quite snappy and no delay in response at all.Unless, you like clicking pictures or gaming, this phone isn't for you.I'm writing this review after a use of almost 8 months. So, its all true and legit.For this price though, you should really check out the Redmi range of smartphones.***Used for a yearHeating problem (it heats more than mi phone)Glass very weak (it fell frm 7cms n broked(fell frm a dictionary) though i replaced it for free during free screen replacement period)Unexpected hanging problems (the phone hangs without any region n its very difficult to restart it afterwards too)Camera is soo soo bad,worst i have ever seen,it knew it would b bad,bt i didnt expctd it to b this bad,the front camera gvs clearer images thn the rear oneVery bad battery backup***It does have good look beside it have metallic body plus it have quite great finishing.

I trust the company and have been using alot of electronics and stuff of theirs never had any issues they are definitely much better than Chinese products their brand speaks about it also that extra star is it's one of the phones with least radiation which is one factor on my priority list while purchasing cell phones. The company needs to come up with a power pack phone which is also budget friendly because they already have a hands on, on build quality and design to compete with these oppo poco mi etc..***ProsA good 18:9 aspect ratio.

Battery backup could have been more. Camera quality is good. Touch screen and display quality is excellent. User interface is intuitive.***Phone looks extremely niche, display is vibrant,. I ordered golden color. Phone heats if used to play games for a long time but doesnt matter to me, i m not a gamer.I thought the phone i received is a used one, when i switched it on for the first time, erasing message popped up first.***Worst phone ever.

It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category.Pros:Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM .Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to)Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones.Sound is good -clear and audible.Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though.Sturdy phone for long durability.Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale.Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera.

Its been 5 days and no pick up arranged. I got this phone for my aged mother who is comfortable to use a feature phone.  The purpose is lost when you cant hear the conversation.Will Amazon/seller help me with replacement.  This is still in warranty period***This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it.Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments.Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied.Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons)Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders.Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan.Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.***No metal parts.. feels a very cheep phone... Screen was not that much good.***Sound quality is best.Image quality is best as far as this small handset is considered.Thw only one thing i disliked is that nokia changed the keypad locking style (in old models it was press OK and then *.

This memory card has the Lowest Price among all the other 16 gb cards available in the market.2. I have been using it for 2 years, and it's still performing great. So, it's hopefully very Long-Lasting.3. Amazon is providing this memory card at a very Low Price (due to the Great offers & discounts)  Cons:1. Transferring Speed is slow.2. Due to slow speed, it does not support 4K videos.  Sandisk is one of the most Trusted & Popular companies for storage devices in the world. This product by them is also Good. I was fully satisfied with this memory card at this low price. You can undoubtedly go for this product within this Budget.

I suggest you to buy class 10 so it will give enough processing power to do copying, moving etc. Ofcourse if you're not everyday user and you want to just save music and videos then it's for you***SanDisk is my preferred memory card for a long time. This card too is not an exception. Worked perfectly straight out of the box. Read/write speed is very good. No slowdown or lag when playing games or videos on my mobile phone. And from my own experience this card is going to last a long time.***Verdict : When I bought this a few years ago, it was the best buy at its price, but now there are better options available at same price, considering that this is class 4 card, and now in the same price class 10 cards are available.Pros:1. Good durability, has been working for 3> years2. Transfer speed as expected, if someone says its slow, then either they need a higher class card or their particular card is faulty.3. Price was competitive when I bought it4. Sandisk as a brand is trustable.Cons1. Not really a con, but now class 10 cards which have better speed are available at same price.***Ordered something for first time on the Internet and thing was this SD Card. At that time, it costed me just around Rs 200. I actually bought it for my new phone, and that phone has begun to suck now but this SD Card still works absolutely fine. The brand is SanDisk and it doesn't lets you to doubt its quality.Now, talking about the condition of delivery. The package in which this sd card was delivered made my mom wonder if it was actually sd card or a damn phone. The delivery was on time. Thanks Amazon!***I have brought it some 2 years back and still it the memory card is is working.. Amazon.in provides only original products. Thank you amazon***I got my 16gb SD card and it is awesome. As soon as the SD card arrived, I inserted it in my phone, so I can't take any images of it. I have only 4 stars because it came from Karnataka, but it took 4.5 days to arrive, that's why I gave only 4 stars. 😉😶😅***"

Offer limited.,"Compatible with all types of air vent (thin or thick, circular or horizontal) with it's advanced rubber grip.Rubberised holder sides ensure no damage or scratch to your phoneRound Edge and Non-Slip Grip to hold your phone tightly even in case of high bumps or turbulence.Fits all smartphones upto 6.3 inch screen size including iPhone, Samsung, Lenovo, Moto, Xiaomi, etcLightweight, pocket friendly, portable design. Can be used in any car, anytime unlike traditional mounts which are fixed.","Finally I found the solution of phone heating during map use on my phone. In case if you use a normal wind shield vacuum holder, the Phone could caught with excessive heat, right below the Sun & in case if your GPS is on.Now I keep my phone over AC vent onto this holder & AC chilled wind keeps it ice chilled. However, do not forget to wrap the phone with your hanky or a sweatproof cloth, once you come out of car to rinse out of sudden moisture generation over phone body.Looks so cute too. A must have for tourers & drivers.***Decent build Quality. Grip is good - it never slipped out of Air vents over the last 6 months of use. However, the phones tend to be in line of very cold AC air and the battery starts losing  charge at an alarming speed. Tried various phones with different battery life and age of battery - but it loses battery at atleast 4 to 7 times faster when placed in the air vent holder.***Okay, I have bought this product twice in a duration of 3-4 months. Because I lost the first one when my vehicle got serviced.It is not easy to use, take effort to put inside vents also opening it and putting your mobile is slightly difficult. I still bought it second time because it gives me flexibility to remove from one side and put to another (though mobile blocks vents as well).Also since it is economical so okay even if it lasts not so long.The main purpose of car mobile holders is that you use navigation, which is only required when you are on not a familiar route. It serves that purpose !***Not good. Takes a lot of effort to push this guy in the vent. Gets bent every new time you try to insert. After couple of weeks the rubber coating wears off and the metal starts showing up. This metal then makes scratch marks on your AC vents. Not worth it guys..You will be really disappointed. I am using Tech sense magnet holders these days, got it in offer. It works like charm.***Good material and tough built. Holds the mobile (mine is a heavy one - Lenovo Vibe P1a) well. Drove in village roads with huge potholes in speed and slow, didn't fall. Only drawback is, the fixing clip being short and wide in diameter, does not go much inside the fins and tends to stay out. The manufacturer should work on this. Except this, this is a great product.***Quality and finish of the product is good. The grip of the vent holding tongs and the phone holder arms is excellent. I am giving it 3 stars as when the phone is mounted in the holder, it blocks a vent. If you keep the vent open and AC running, then in humid conditions like Mumbai, a lot of condensation gathers on the phone. Otherwise excellent product for the price.***This product is absolutely very useful. Its so simple to attach to the car AC vent and it holds the phone very tightly without any shakes or vibrations.I am loving it from day one. Amazon also delivered this product promptly.***Lock and unlocking mechanisim can be made user friendly have to use two hand for streching and locking the device ... but it of great build quality with rubberized rigit surface.***"

Also, don’t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says “Pairing mode”.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn’t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone’s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth’s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don’t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of ₹1499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***"

Tarkan [Rubberized] Air Vent Universal Car Mount Holder for All Mobile Phones [4 Inch to 6.3 Inch],TARKAN,https://www.amazon.in/Tarkan-Rubberized-Premium-Universal-Holder/dp/B01N631VMT/ref=sr_1_436?keywords=phone&qid=1563168159&s=electronics&smid=A3DJ06F5F2CS19&sr=1-436,,229,3.9 out of 5 stars,574 customer reviews,51 answered questions,The most advanced and most popular car mount at amazing price. Offer limited.,"Compatible with all types of air vent (thin or thick, circular or horizontal) with it's advanced rubber grip.Rubberised holder sides ensure no damage or scratch to your phoneRound Edge and Non-Slip Grip to hold your phone tightly even in case of high bumps or turbulence.Fits all smartphones upto 6.3 inch screen size including iPhone, Samsung, Lenovo, Moto, Xiaomi, etcLightweight, pocket friendly, portable design. Can be used in any car, anytime unlike traditional mounts which are fixed.","Finally I found the solution of phone heating during map use on my phone. In case if you use a normal wind shield vacuum holder, the Phone could caught with excessive heat, right below the Sun & in case if your GPS is on.Now I keep my phone over AC vent onto this holder & AC chilled wind keeps it ice chilled. However, do not forget to wrap the phone with your hanky or a sweatproof cloth, once you come out of car to rinse out of sudden moisture generation over phone body.Looks so cute too. A must have for tourers & drivers.***Decent build Quality. Grip is good - it never slipped out of Air vents over the last 6 months of use. However, the phones tend to be in line of very cold AC air and the battery starts losing  charge at an alarming speed. Tried various phones with different battery life and age of battery - but it loses battery at atleast 4 to 7 times faster when placed in the air vent holder.***Okay, I have bought this product twice in a duration of 3-4 months. Because I lost the first one when my vehicle got serviced.It is not easy to use, take effort to put inside vents also opening it and putting your mobile is slightly difficult. I still bought it second time because it gives me flexibility to remove from one side and put to another (though mobile blocks vents as well).Also since it is economical so okay even if it lasts not so long.The main purpose of car mobile holders is that you use navigation, which is only required when you are on not a familiar route. It serves that purpose !***Not good. Takes a lot of effort to push this guy in the vent. Gets bent every new time you try to insert. After couple of weeks the rubber coating wears off and the metal starts showing up. This metal then makes scratch marks on your AC vents. Not worth it guys..You will be really disappointed. I am using Tech sense magnet holders these days, got it in offer. It works like charm.***Good material and tough built. Holds the mobile (mine is a heavy one - Lenovo Vibe P1a) well. Drove in village roads with huge potholes in speed and slow, didn't fall. Only drawback is, the fixing clip being short and wide in diameter, does not go much inside the fins and tends to stay out. The manufacturer should work on this. Except this, this is a great product.***Quality and finish of the product is good. The grip of the vent holding tongs and the phone holder arms is excellent. I am giving it 3 stars as when the phone is mounted in the holder, it blocks a vent. If you keep the vent open and AC running, then in humid conditions like Mumbai, a lot of condensation gathers on the phone. Otherwise excellent product for the price.***This product is absolutely very useful. Its so simple to attach to the car AC vent and it holds the phone very tightly without any shakes or vibrations.I am loving it from day one. Amazon also delivered this product promptly.***Lock and unlocking mechanisim can be made user friendly have to use two hand for streching and locking the device ... but it of great build quality with rubberized rigit surface.***"

Also, don’t expect it to offer the same experience as in wired earphones of this price segment.The build quality of the earphones is impressive. It also comes with an official IPX4 rating, so it can survive the splash of water and sweat. It is also really light in weight and weighs just 13.6 grabs. So, it is comfortable for long usage.When you turn it on or off, it also plays voice notification to let you know if it is turned on or off. For pairing it with a new device, you need to understand one important thing. When you turn it on, you need to keep pressing the power button until the LED notification starts blinking fast. This puts the earphone in the pairing mode and voice notification says “Pairing mode”.When it comes to sound clarity, it impresses. I tested it with different kinds of tracks and it was good. It is loud, so the noise of the surrounding will not affect you when you are using it. Xiaomi claims dynamic bass feature that didn’t impress. The bass is average, so it will disappoint you if you love bass heavy music. Same goes with treble. It means this earphone is not for you if you are looking for good music experience, then you will also have to increase your budget because not much options are there in this price segment. I find it good considering the priceIt supports Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity with Bluetooth profiles like HFP, A2DP, HSP, and AVRCP. As soon as you turn it on, it instantly connects to the phone it was already paired if Phone’s Bluetooth is on. It also works fine under the Bluetooth’s operating range.As it has a microphone, you can use it for hands-free calls. Just press the center button to accept the call and start talking. The microphone performs well and it captures your proper voiceIt packs 120 mAh battery and the battery lasts for around 8 hours in regular usage. My usages were mixed of tracks on high and medium sound levels with not many calls. If you will use it on high volume all the time, battery back up will be lower. The battery takes around one and a half hour in fully charging.This earphone is good for regular use when you need a Bluetooth earphone for hands-free calls and occasionally listening to music. I don’t recommend it to music freaks, but it is still good enough considering its priceThanks for reading the review.***Hey everyone, recently I have bought this earphones and I am reviewing this earphones after using it intensively. So here is my experience after using this earphones.# Packing & Box Contents:- It comes in a orange colour cardboard box and the box contents are as follows:-* Wireless Earphones* Extra Earbuds (4x)* USB cable for charging* Warranty card & instruction manual. (Images attached)# Build Quality:- The earphones have a nice build quality it's made up of plastic this makes the earphones lightweight and it can handle normal daily wear and tear for a long time.* It is light weight it will not hurt you for long usage but after using it for more than 30-40 mins it feels quite uncomfortable in my ears.* The wire is of average quality I think the wires of this earphones might not last long. (I will update my review if I see any issues with the wire)# Features:- It has a microphone so that you can accept the calls on the go.* There are three buttons  (Volume + & - these buttons can also be used to change music tracks if you press it for 2 seconds the track will change)* The hooks present in the earphones gives a good fitting in the ears.* And middle button used as a multifunction button to pause/play, accept/reject the call, power on/off.* It is water resistant so you don't have to worry if you are in rain or you got sweaty while working out. It is having a rating of IPX4.# How to use??Switching ON/OFF :- To switch to on all you have to do is press the power button which is on the right side.Pairing Mode :- For pairing when it switches on it automatically goes to Pairing mode and then you can pair it with your phone.# Sound quality:-* The sound quality is just awesome & the bass is also great.It has a nice HD audio quality.* It has a nice isolating fit and you can also enjoy your music in noisy places also. If you are not getting the perfect fit I will recommend you to try the extra buds which are given in the package.# Battery Backup :- The battery backup claimed by Xiaomi is 9 hours but in my case in one charge it can last for 7 hours which is great.# It comes with just 6 months warranty.# Verdict :- If you are looking for a wireless earphones for below 2k then you can buy this earphones without giving any second thought. You can use this while working out in gym, jogging or doing exercise. There will be no problem like the wire is disturbing you or the wire is coming in front of your face (mainly it happens in wired earphones) while you are doing any activity.* Well this is a good wireless earphones in terms of sound quality but the quality of the wires are average considering the price point of ₹1499 this is a good  wireless earphones.I am reducing one star as the quality of the wires are average.*NOTE:- It is not having the feature like if the power button is pressed for 0.5 seconds then the Google assistant will get activated which is a very helpful feature many different brands offer this feature.Thank you for reading my review. I have attached few images of the earphones.Regards,Nishant Lala.***Cons1. After reading lots of feature lost on mi site i decided to buy this product. I wont ever rate 1 star. Bcz it has lot of signal droping problem. U can't even put your phone in ur jeans pocket. Then signal will start droping. For best performance u have to keep ur phone in shirt pocket or in hand, which is practically not possible. Cant even listen a full song continuously without dropping, 100+ times signal droping. Which is very annoying2. Very delicate wires.3. Difficult to wear more than 30mins, as is design is on lil bulky side to fit.Pros.1. Sound quality is decent for the price2. Battery is good3. Overall light weight***Good quality... very nice..value for money.. thank you so much Amazon... good work... highly recommend thank you for your valuable product.***Absolutely loved it! I was unsure whether to go for Mi or Boat(as Boat's was selling for 1000 bucks at the time). But I made the right decision! It holds on to your ears like an ex girlfriend who would not leave you at all costs. The sound quality is amazing! Especially after I enabled Dolby atmos from my Samsung smart phone, the depth blew me away! As it comes with additional set of ear buds with smaller size, you can be sure that it will fit you to near perfection. Unless, that is, You have ears like Amir khan. All in all, great earphones with beautiful depth, amazing quality, wont leave your ears like that annoying office colleague during lunch.Bottom line - Buy it ASAP!***It was awesome product from mi in this price range, thanks from mi such a good froduct u will not feel uncomfortable after 2hours also the ear buds are that mach comfortable....I like it charging is good call quality is good...no noice noted .. thanks MI......***"

Since today morning it has stopped working. Its neither charging nor showing Link even though everything is properly connected. Not sure what to do with it now. Horrible product and seller.***I am using for last one month.It's entry level cordless phone, good for those who are not looking a fully feature loaded phone. My observations are:It's base need power to use so better to connect to inverter point.Sound is good, only once other person said that his voice is echoing. May be because that time earpiece volume was at max. These are hollow piece so great chance of echo. But on an average its good. +There could be network induced echo.It has 50 contact memory with one number per contact with name (16 character limit, like old mobiles).The phonebook and incoming call list is probably saved in base so you can't see them when no power is available to base / no link between.Looking for call is easy just press left nav key for incoming and outgoing by right key. There is a catch, for incoming it saves time but not for outgoing. Single list for all incoming call and missed calls (20 entries).It have few (or many) ringtones (6 tone and 14 melody). But I like basic one and other feel like old toy tones. Who wants to play jingle bells or london bridge is falling down as ringtone. :-P All melodies are more like a car reverse horn. One can live with tones.Keypad is good and instead of ""off"" they should given better name to key. Further, 2 separate keys for pause and flash is overkill. I hardly used in 2 decade on any phone.Its not having speaker phone, as its basis cordless phone.You can mount base on the wall.I know some people says its costly but I must say its quality they will get. Panasonic is good name or equivalent to cordless in India. I have used GE branded cordless combo but that haven't survived long (less than 2 yr).***Good cordless phone with sufficient battery life. Only minus with this product that this model doesn't have loud speaker option. The next model has that feature. May be that is the reason why it is 500 less than next model.***Its worst.....I made a mistake of throwing the box after receiving the box...after I made my cordless phone into charge....within a day..no tower in it..no connection....I always buy goods in amazon....its very sad that amazon are giving faulty pieces.....***Generally its so Hard to Purchase a Product with some Bad Reviews In it. It deserves 5 Stars, Because It is working well since I bought this.It takes Up-to 8 Hours charge and Gives Up-to 7 hours to 8 Hours of Talk Time and I think this is Good Enough.***Phone worked fine for 2 years. Audio then became totally garbled. Replaced the battery, worked again for two months and then went back to garbled audio. Now replacing the phone. 2 years seems to be a rather short lifespan for a cordless.--This is my sole landline phone and it has been doing an excellent job since Oct 2016. I had to replace the battery in Nov 2018. Excellent phone and decent programmability for the price. It is a basic configuration - no speaker phone, base pad dialing etc, but works well.***I would have given a three star..but the supplier is pathetic...the device is working...but the connecting code is not...i tried all means initially and found out that the code is not working after I used the code of my old phone and the device worked.after that. This shows how careless the supplier is and how bad is their.quality check process.Lookimg forward to the supplier replac***The phone looks really good. But id doesn’t have a speaker option which is big deal for me.My old panasonic cordless had speaker. But the LCD on this one is much clearer than the old one.50 entry address book is also a limitation. The ringer is not loud enough and the ring tones are like poor imitation of Bollywood songs.But overall it does act like a basic phone. The cost is mainly for the brand name and not for the product. Not a “value for money” purchase.***"

However good the product may seem never buy a Motorola product just for the way they treat their customers after purchase. It has been more than 1 year since i have been using this phone and i have been literally fighting with the service centre every now and then. Every single visit of mine to the service centre somehow ends up in a fight and i do find most of my fellow customers either supporting me or starting a fight all by themselves all through the durations of time that i spend there. From my experience i can easily say this is the worst mobile service centre you can find. If you still want to go ahead and buy a Motorola make sure you completely know how to repair your phone or make sure you do know someone who can help. In simple words Motorola SUCKS.***Few highlights after 1 year of usage:-1) Battery: Lasts a day or more. Depends heavily on the usage. Sometimes drains with 4G and draining apps.2) Camera: Expected a bit more from the camera especially the dual lens setup from Moto. It does a decent job but not top notch. Don't expect OnePlus like pictures (obviously) without editing. Selfie camera is good enough though.3) Software: Bad experience here. Motorola management and devs need to up their game because we're getting Android Oreo after almost a year while Motorola promised it in early 2018. Only security patch updates were provided for a 16k phone with other competitors in the market. Software experience is stock though which is very good, no bloatware.4) Gestures: I think the gestures and one button navigation is one of the best features of this smartphone. I use it on a daily basis (gestures only, not a big fan of single button navigation gestures but many people like it).5) Turbo Charger: Very good, provides a great amount of charge in less time. One of the best that I've seen. But the cable plastic end got frayed.6) Display & Design: Top notch for the price. One of the best in this price segment. However, the design gets wasted if you put it in a case :)7) Rest: Snapdragon 625, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage, no complaints here. Performance wise its good! (Funny though that Moto G6 has Snapdragon 450 for the same price at launch! What are you doing Moto?).***Don't go for this mobile. Not at all receiving the signal and call quality is very bad. Being a 4gb ram, hanging frequently and low battery. Because of signal problem, battery is draining dramatically. Wast of  money only***Camera is not that much good in low lighting worst performance and the main Problem​ is in wifi issue disconnected randomly over all not worth to buy***I disliked the product. It's overheating while using any app. And super heating while on charging. In fact it's so hot that I can iron my clothes with it. I wondered why Motorola didn't hilight this iron heating portable iron feature in commercial. Also they do not provide you the replacement in customer care center they just keep repairing your brand new phone and will make it refurbished. Don't buy it people. I lost my faith in Motorola Lenovo.***I am writing this review after 10 months. So here I am sharing my personal experiences with this phone:First of all thanks to Amazon for its prompt delivery and thanks to Seller Darshita Electronics for sending this product in good condition.Pros:Build Quality: Very good build qualityPerformance: Performance is very good no lags are experienced till now.Sound Quality: Good but not much loud. I liked it personally.Camera Quality: Good in Outdoor also 4K video recording is bundled.FingerPrint Scanner: Responsive scanner. It detects the finger print quite fast.Battery Backup: Good if you are on Android Nougat. It stays almost one day of heavy usage.TurboCharging: Fast charging is available on this device and it charges quickly.Cons:Camera Quality: Disappointed with image processing from this camera. i can say it was below average. The Dual Camera setup was a disappointment. But soon Motorola had released the camera updates and it improved in great extent. I can say the Dual camera is properly implemented after lot of updates from Motorola. Color reproduction of this camera is a below average it did not process the image if i compare it with Google camera which is installed in my device and also very surprised that images shot with Google camera app are far better than the Motorola's stock camera app as it is using same sensor. Don't know why Motorola is not working on the camera quality.Camera Bumps: As we know that Camera Bumps are bit outwards on this model so there is a chance for scratches on the camera glass so better to have a protective back cover with camera protection.Regular Updates: Updates are not in the list of Motorola as they are focusing on their new models so ignoring the previous models. I have recently got the Oreo updates after so much waiting. Very poor service when it comes to the updates from Motorola.Battery backup: Battery backup deteriorates after upgrading to Android Oreo. I have noticed the next day i have to charge two time a day after upgrading. Now waiting for the next update hope this will be fixed in next update.Final Verdict: If you are a camera freak and expecting for some great shots then this phone will give you an average quality so better think for other options available in the market. But if you are an average user with some budget restrictions then go for it.The above said are my experiences with this phone and my overall rating for this phone will be 3.5.***G5s plus is best camera is really superb,sound is fantastic, battery performance is also good m doing after 2weeks m posting this review go for g5s plus it's buttry smooth low lights pictures are also good daylight pic are really amazing what Moto need to imporve is front camera with portrait mode nothing else  m really happy with my g5s plus sry for not more pictures due to some problem with photos that's y I upload a single pic about battery and that's amazing superb battery backup thank you Amazon***"

The answer is was correct, i could use it as a intercom handset. but the pin wasnt in built, i had to call the intercom helpline and ask for their help to get it connected. that was additional headache ... Additionally agfter few days i have noticed that the handset does not fit properly onto its base. even though its put carefully, the line is not disconnected properly and after few seconds the alarm tone starts , if you do not notice by mistake , nobody can call you and even if you notice and put it carefully back the same thing happens again and again. really unhappy with the phone***Returning this product for second time as both the instruments doesn’t have socket to connect intercom cables***Good colour.

But if you use equalizer the audio comes out great . The USP i felt of these earphones is that these are very durable , the wire is thick and strong enough and the earpieces are made out of metal which looks and feels strong enough .Well in this price range i have used all the earphones including the JBL C100SI , the Senheiser CX180 , The house of Marley Smile Jamaica even the Boat ones. These arr the best you can get if you want Durability. But if you want better audio quality , go for the JBL ones. I posted because i felt i should share this information as i have used all of the earphones in this price range.Update :7 months and they are still working great . No complaints till now.***Strange but the sound quality is nowhere near 500 to 1000 mark; its way above. Average bass, clear sound and decent build quality is what everyone expects from a average priced earphone and thats what this delivers. Believe me when I say all this because I have used from rs.300 to 3k in ear earphones and have decent understanding of sound and build quality of earphones.The reviews down below where some have mentioned of fake product, it is not, it's the same as detailed in mi india site.Update:It's been quite sometime now. I bought 2 pairs some time in September 2018. I still stand by my words as mentioned above. The headphones are now fully burned to give optimum sound. Still my go to pair of headphones as an alternative to full headset.***This earphn is super.There is no extra bass.You will enjoy smooth bass and a clear music according to the song.***This is not as per value and the expectations. JBL CS100 is far far batter. No such bass effect, watching movies is worst you need to keep on pressing earbeard to ear to get voice clear. There is no such feature call noise cancellation it's only on paper. Want to switch JBL again I've mi phone still it's not reaching its standards.***I got this Mi Earphones with mic (Silver) for Rs.699. (MRP). Works Decently.

Ltd.***Amazing sound, great balance of bass. I had same type of JBL and Sennheiser earphones before which were more expensive, but I think sound quality of Mi is definitely better than of Sennheiser and even better than of JBL. But JBL lasted really long. Let's see about this.***Awesome earphone at this price @599Mi always doing good work.Special instructions for seller , please check the box and quantity then send to customer.Firstly I got volume down button was not working. Second time I got only earburd, Third time I got finally in well.***One of the worst I've ever had the misfortune to buy. In three days, the left ear bud stopped working. Durability: nil. The wires twist and tangle.Sound quality is no match for better quality earphones. I'm no audiophile, but it lacks clarity. The design is not ergonomic. Hurts the external ear. Using for a long time like I do, gave me pain in my jaw and teeth.Near zero noise cancellation unless it's at 100% volume which is hurtful.The item is supposed to come with extra earbuds. They were missing in both packs.Unfortunately, I couldn't return the piece. Just exchange this useless product. I've not even bothered to return the exchanged item because I'll not get a refund.So not worth it.***"

(i cant comment much on the gaming performance)Read / watched quite a lot of reviews and made my decision over One Plus 6T.Rear Camera :Crisp and clear image and hardly no difference with 1+. 4K videos and full HD videos, background blur in the video, are cool features.Night mode is amazing., better than 1+48MP AI camera is just fine, its not Wow.  You expect a lot more for that number. It matches ip with 1+Slow motion is only @ 720p.. 1+ is better off.Front cam pics are good, but videos are more stable in 1+ as V20 does not have image stabilization for front cam., hope there's a firmware update soon.Too many options available for photos and videos., You need to explore hands on to get the real feel of all the features.Personally i prefer the punch hole over the water drop notch. The screen looks bigger and the notch does not bother much.Needless to say about the design of V20, definitely gives a premium than the 1+Headphone jack, IR sensor, Notification lights are cool features to have (all 3 are missing in 1+)Lcd IPS display in V20 vs Amoled display in the 1+, which means though the battery might look bigger in number on the V20.,  1+ will last a few hours more.. The display in V20 is still good.User interface is better in the 1+ and honor's magic UI is way behind.The silicon back case is perfect.Overall not much of a difference between Honor V20 and 1+6T in terms of performance, display, battery or camera.Its good to hold a top notch, latest phone with first in class latest specs. Go for it. I'm happy with the phone.***It's nor worth for money.. Camera is very normal as 12MP only. Dunno in what basis they are saying it as 48MP. It's not going zoomin dept as oneplus 6T goes. Indoor pics are not that good. Even nyt shoot ll be better in vivo or oppo than this one. If anyone is going to get this mob just for a cam don't buy. It's my suggestion. Battery is gud but not as moto or one plus provides. Display is gud.***this is my initial review will post again after few weeks1) Display (6/10)- yes its a punch hole but panel quality is average2) Selfie camera(6/10) - images are soft when taken indoors.3) Rear Camera (7.5/10) - good photos in good light, hit and a miss affair in an indoor/low light situation.4) Performance (9/10) is very good , no lags.5) There is a vibration felt in the phone when talking to someone, feels hollow inside.6) Sound output via earphones is good but not great7) Speakers are average.30k would have justified the cost for this phone but 38k its not worth.***Honor / Huawei made another gorgeous look handset in 2019.I received the same yesterday, so few points I can elaborate today, but I definitely revise my review soon after a month or two.1. Look is stunning2. Rear Camera is awesome though its hard to understand that what 3D TOF actually is. But 48Megapixels are more than enough, you can ZOOM how much you want but PPI (Pixel per inches) will never fetch3. Front Camera - Same as above, (Do not forget to OFF beauty plus button) front camera is also stunning.4. Turbo/Super charging. I charged it only 20 minutes yesterday and battery goes 5% t0 76%.5. Size is almost same as Honor 9i was. Though molded screen is better than that.6 NO heat till yet, though phone was hot when the delivery agent bring it to me but that because he took the box in sunlight before delivering (In his back pack and he was on two wheeler)7. Sound is good, not too awesome.And You can not add external microphone in honor 20 while recording a video. But in other androids, you can add the same easily.Overall phone is better than Iphone ;) . Revised reviewThanksSiddharth Arora***Used it for more than 2 hours, the display looks great with punch hole technology. Battery life and camera are things which are yet to be tested by me. I will update this review after 2 days of use.So far so good***Better then 6t***Just now i got mobile... Excellent performance,  sounds and camera are awesome. I will post after usage of other spec.***"

When i set the battery by adding a SIM card in it, and try to switch it on, it starts, but by pressing any key it goes switch off. after so many times, i found that the battery get disconnected by pressing any keys frequently any time. so you have to use this mobile like a cup of glass. If mobile pressed little bit in pocket, it goes switch off. if press the lock button little harder, mobile goes switch off. Really bad device if you wont get a proper model or tough body mobile. I have asked for replacement, lets see what my luck will say on replaced mobile. Otherwise i definitely ask for refund. All the best to new buyers.***Do not buy. The battery life is less than 7 months. After 6 months it is not even coming for one phone call. The bad part is that they give battery warranty only for 6 months.

It don't work and most unreliable phone. Just wasted money.***Seniorworld Easyfone is an excellent product matched with equal service support from the seniorworld . I brought this product for my senior citizen mother who is 80 years with multiple problems of parkinson, hearing problem and arthiritis and usual age related ailments ( loneliness - esp after the loss of her companion of 56 years a few years back. Easyfone has become her second best companion after me her son with whom she can keep in touch with with it's better speech quality and easy big digit pad and clock etc. In her over eagerness to keep the phone charged always she has been keeping it plugged on always which led to the battery going bad on the 11th month of the one year warranty. One call to the Seniorworld executive at gurgaon the battery was replaced without extra charge and even though I had purchased it through amazon.

They can't read English. There is no Telugu language. An educated elder person can use smartphone. It is very difficult to operate. No shortcut options.

It was faced globally. The voice is not at all audible on outgoing calls sometimes.Although Moto brought out a fix for this in other countries, Indian version still has same issue.Other than that, it is a bit overpriced.Quite user friendly thoughShould be made under Android One***Got this phone as part of festival deal at very reasonable price. Little disappointed with the stock Google on it. Migrated from Lenovo K4 Note to Moto G6 Plus and completely missing the features provided by Lenovo utilities. Camera outer lining started decoloring in 2 weeks due to engraved camera. External SD card cannot be used as adoptive memory to extend internal memory which was available in Lenovo phone.

Only not very happy with the camera quality , had been using the Moto X Play n the camera was awesome.Very very disappointed with this phone.The backcase cracked with a small drop. Even the cheapest phone has never to deal with a cracked backcase. Don't buy***FOR ALL MOTO FANs:Don't buy this.Its been 3 months running and too many problems. Its a 6GB ram phone but does not act like 6GB RAM phone. Big files like pubg, asphalt lags alot. Auto shutdown or hang happens quite offen. Internet, wifi, Bluetooth connections are all the worst. Screen is too bad. You cannot play games like pubg as You can see the spot where your thumbs touch after 2 months and it is permanent. Old moto phone i played for more than 1 year with no problem on the screen. SCREEN has too many reflections. Little light presence can cause shiny reflection on your screen so you are not able to play, watch movie. In order to avoid this you have to either switch off the light or set the brightness high. You cannot even get a good fit phone cover, back case. PRICE IS HIGH. DO NOT GO FOR THIS, MOTO, CHECK OUT OTHER MODEL. till now.  I tell you: THIS IS NO MOTO PHONE.***Got this on sale with exchange for less than half the retail price. I've owned and used Moto phones before and they're sturdy and reliable; decent performance, decent cameras, decent battery and none of the strange frustrating annoyances you sometimes get with cheaper Android phones. Motorola is one of the very few brands in the mid range that makes near vanilla Android phones- so no bloatware out of the box, no crappy UI or software skin to deal with and fast updates.Battery life should be decent; I'll update this review if it isn't. Screen is sharp and clean and bright; colours not as beautiful as a Pixel or One Plus but good enough. The charging cable is a little short, but it's USB type C so I've plenty of substitutes around the house. It comes bundled with white earphones of surprisingly reasonable quality and 3 pairs of replacement cups.My only complaint is that the phone itself is a little too big and heavy, but nothing you can't get used to. About the same dimensions as a One Plus 5. Overall an excellent phone for the money. Will do 80% of what flagships do and 100% of what most people who buy flagships want from their phones anyway.***It is definitely not a ""Bang for the Buck"" kinda product. It does feels premium than any other device under 16k. Plus does have a USB Type C. It does lagged a bit on Android Oreo (8) but after Android Pie (9) update it is smooth. The Snapdragon 630 is a bit outdated processor but still does the job with quite ease.Build:Glass with aluminium build. The only thing which bothers me is the Sim Tray! It is so plasticy. But doesn't matter if you don't frequently ejecting and swapping sims.Display:It is not bad.Camera:A good one in the daylight. But great in the low light situation. Supports 4K 30fps Video recording but doesn't have EIS. 1080p 60fps is also available but no EIS there. 1080p 30fps has the EIS.Battery:Great for a 3200Mah Battery. Not outstanding or bad. It does last for a day unless yours is defective. And plus it charges up in less than 1.2Hrs.Performance:It is a SD630 with 6 gigs of ram and apps runs smoothly. Can only play PUBG in lowest settings as default. But if you use GFX Tool can run PUBG on HD settings and 60fps with almost no lag. It'd be butter smooth in 30fps or medium settings.Cons:Everything is not built for everyone. It is a bit slippery due to the glass build. But the Corning Gorilla Glass 3 does a good job against scratches. It is a bit longer than usual competition but the width is good for grabbing in one hand. (BTW I don't recommend it to people with small hands and rough usage). Camera bumb is a little bulgy than usual moto phones, but you can always place it facing upside down. And it helps to protect it against scratches.Conclusion:It is has a good build but a older processor. If you are looking for a premium looking phone for under 16k it does it well. You can play pubg on low to hd settings without any issues. The major issue with this phone was its pricing (23k @ launch) and it got many criticism due to the price to performance ratio. But now (2-02-2019) it is under 16k. For this price it is a good choice but definitely not for everyone product.***Awesome phone with all the features on offer.Pros -PerformanceBatteryDisplayLooksSounds mind-blowingCamera average, but good in this price rangeConsFront firing single speaker is not too loud and it is not too low either.Camera bump could have been avoidedVibration is not too good to be noticed, one may end up losing calls or notification due to low sound and vibrationOverall it is a good and sturdy product.***There was a problem in this phone but at the day I can't get replacement***"

Handset2. Charger (5V 2A)3. USB charging cable4. Sim ejector pin5. Translucent CaseDesign:The design of Note 6 Pro same as that of Note 5 Pro so nothing special here. The build quality is decent, and phone feels good in hand. Rating 8/10.Display:The display on the front is a Full HD 6.3-inch notch display with 19:9 aspect ratio. The display is sharp and bright with good viewing angles and colors. It is covered with a 2.5D glass which gives it a premium look. The notch on the top is big and there is a significant chin at the bottom as well. I think Xiaomi could have done a bit better here. Big notches mean less space for notification icons so that’s not great. Rating 8/10.Battery:The phone comes with a 4000 mAh battery which is also same as Note 5 Pro. So, with moderate usage you can expect a battery backup of 2 days on a single charge. One nice improvement in Note 6 Pro is that Quick Charge 3.0 is available now. The phone does not come with a fast charger though and you need to buy it separately. Rating 10/10.Audio:The speaker at the bottom of the device is surprisingly very loud and clear. The audio via the earphone is average if you don’t tweak the settings. So, I’d recommend going into setting and use the equalizer and sound enhancer options to improve audio via 3.5mm jack. Rating 8.5/10.Performance:The Note 6 Pro runs on same Snapdragon 636. Snapdragon 636 is a good midrange chipset with performance and efficiency, so we have no complaints. App opens and close fast. Gaming is smooth as well. If you use a ton of apps then maybe go for the 6GB RAM variant. Rating 8.5/10.Security:Both fingerprint sensor and face unlock work well on the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate while the Face unlock takes a bit of time (less than a second) to unlock the device. Face unlock is not that secure and can unlocked by another person so don’t use it if you have something on your phone that should not be seen by others. Rating 9/10.Pricing:The pricing of Note 6 Pro was a bit of a surprise because Note 5 Pro price was increased from 13999 to 14999 and the Note 6 Pro packs some nice improvements over the 5 Pro so a price increase of 1000 was expected. But instead, Xiaomi launched it at 1000 less i.e. 13999 which is good pricing. If there was no Realme 2 Pro or Honor 8X then price would have been 15999 for sure. Rating: 9/10.Camera:When Redmi Note 5 Pro launched earlier this year, it had one of the best camera in its price range and now Note 6 Pro comes with an improved camera. The aperture and pixel size has improved which means you are going to see a lot of improvement in low light pictures. In earlier tests, the camera performed well and exceeded our expectations.The front camera now gets a secondary sensor for portrait mode pictures. The performance of front camera is good as well. Pictures looks sharp and colorful with good amount of details. The dynamic range wasn’t great though.The camera is impressive. Few camera samples are included in this review, more samples will be added on the final review on our website. Rating 8.5/10.SummaryOverall, Redmi Note 6 Pro is a well-balanced smartphone at 13999, we think it offers good value for money. If you have a budget of around 15000 and need a phone with good build, good cameras, excellent battery, loud speaker, fast charging then Note 6 Pro should be your choice.If you need a better-looking phone and can compromise with the camera quality and battery backup, then Realme 2 Pro and Honor 8X are good options.If you already have the Note 5 Pro, then you should skip the Note 6 Pro as it is not that big of an upgrade.Which Color is the best?If you like to keep things simple, then go for the Black color. If you need something bright and flashy then go for the Blue color which looks really nice.I hope you liked the review. If it was helpful, please give thumbs-up/upvote.***I purchased this phone on 23rd of December 2017 and writing this review on 15th December 2108. For the last couple of months, my mi 4 is giving problems. Phone rings but screen sometimes doesn't come alive. Finger print unlocking is very slow, sometimes it takes more than a minute to wake up. If you are in any sort of emergency and need to call, it may deceive you.***Product is smart and it shows good phone on your smart hand but one disappointed out of 4GB RAM 2GB are under inbuilt apps it's not fair deal because only can user decided what app is useful for me and what not....... overall phone is good and performance are better........it's only by name of MI......it's my second MI phone and experience with MI is excellent.***Received the product today.... very disappointed.

We though it could be a network problem. So We wait for it & tried with different networks calling from different location where other phones were working fine. But unfortunately issues was still there.We contacted Amazon as it was under 10 days replacement policy directly from Amazon. They guided us to visit service center to get job deny job sheet from them ( according to them it was a standard process & guidelines from Apple).ALthough it was very painful to visit service center just after three days of purchase of this handset. But we did it. After getting inspection from them they told us that there is no issue with device but problem is with sim card, although it was the same sim which we were using earlier in small keypad phone ( sound & network were amazing at my home & other locations).but still we changed sim card & used it for some days, but issue is still there.As per amazon we have to get job deny job sheet from Apple. As per Apple they wont give it as it can be repair after open the set.But how  can i allow them to open the set within three days of purchase.It is very painful, this is my third purchase of iPhone from Amazon. We never expect these kind irresponsible response from Amazon & Iphone both.We are not purchasing any Iphone from Amazon from now onward.***Really awesome phone... and original mobile... thanxxxx amazon and apple... camera result is awesome...***Super product and quick and safe deliveryFuffy satisfied***A great product! There are multiple reviews in Amazon and on the web.I did not yet feel any lag to the software; recently updated to iOS12 and it is working great.***"

When i set the battery by adding a SIM card in it, and try to switch it on, it starts, but by pressing any key it goes switch off. after so many times, i found that the battery get disconnected by pressing any keys frequently any time. so you have to use this mobile like a cup of glass. If mobile pressed little bit in pocket, it goes switch off. if press the lock button little harder, mobile goes switch off. Really bad device if you wont get a proper model or tough body mobile. I have asked for replacement, lets see what my luck will say on replaced mobile. Otherwise i definitely ask for refund. All the best to new buyers.***Do not buy. The battery life is less than 7 months. After 6 months it is not even coming for one phone call. The bad part is that they give battery warranty only for 6 months. I bought to help my mom, but it ended up as a discomfort. Now i need to find another phone.Speaker phone quality is bad. Senior cannot hear at all :(. Only plus is the key pad which is big. Rest is all zero.***Excellent phone for senior citizens. Got it for my mom and she's very happy using it. She hasn't used the SoS feature etc but the speed dial and big buttons are so handy. This is the review after using it for two months!***Useless Mobile quality, stopped working frequently. Giving pain and tension to SR. Citizen.  That's reason product return Window is 15 days. It don't work and most unreliable phone. Just wasted money.***Seniorworld Easyfone is an excellent product matched with equal service support from the seniorworld . I brought this product for my senior citizen mother who is 80 years with multiple problems of parkinson, hearing problem and arthiritis and usual age related ailments ( loneliness - esp after the loss of her companion of 56 years a few years back. Easyfone has become her second best companion after me her son with whom she can keep in touch with with it's better speech quality and easy big digit pad and clock etc. In her over eagerness to keep the phone charged always she has been keeping it plugged on always which led to the battery going bad on the 11th month of the one year warranty. One call to the Seniorworld executive at gurgaon the battery was replaced without extra charge and even though I had purchased it through amazon. I recommend this simple easyfone a must have all senior elders at home.SeniorWorld Senior Citizen Friendly Easyfone (Black)***I Love the phone, Delivered in my friend’s house and brought it here in Saudi Arabia ahead of the said delivery date, Good for the elderly  and I can’t wait to Bring this in the Philippines and  give to my Uncle.***This phone is basically for uneducated and very old age persons. They can't read English. There is no Telugu language. An educated elder person can use smartphone. It is very difficult to operate. No shortcut options. Sos function is not working properly, it is repeatedly calling sos numbers until we turn off sos.***My search for phone with large keys and legible font ended as soon as I found easyfone..I'm glad that I bought not one but 3 phones..Elders in my family loved it ..They enjoy the radio feature and are also glad to listen to old and devotionl songs with the help of dedicated micro sd card (slot provided)Cradle charger enables them to simply place the phone in it rather than going through the trouble of finding a small charger point..Overall I definitely recommend it as I said I purchased 3 phones..Big thank you and 👍👍***"

Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.***Do not Compare it with Poco F1, Nokia 8.1 shines in its own way.  Buy this, only if have following requirements1) High-quality camera with excellent low light performance2) Premium Design3) Stock Android.4) Good Responsiveness.5) occasional gaming.6) Good Battery backup of nearly 2days on normal use.***After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.***1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.***Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D***"

Specially this card is being used on my raspberry which has remained on for atleast 5 months, 24/7 used to sync repositories every half an hour from git.Speeds are not as fast as they're advertised. But where Strontium shines is in reliability.Only thing missing is a way for the end user to validate if the shipped product is genuine or not.Mark this review a helpful if it helped you in making a decision.***Compared to Sandisk/HP/Samsung, this is priced much lower.I got 118GB out of the 128GB.It is UHS 1  compliant, so should be good for 4K video.At the price point, its a no brainer.***Very fast copying speed***the card speed is not 100mb/s......its actual speed isreading speed approx 20mb/swriting speed approx 25mb/si dont know why written card speed 100mb/s........this is wrong***I had used only Stornium SD card's in many of my phones or tablets or GoPro and all these years getting their high end SD have been great for me.------PROS------Everything works as needed, speed on transfer from PC to this card was closer to 11Mb wish is great for my needs. At current price for U1(Full_HD recording speed) SDcard this is a great product.------CONS------Nothing really***Use it in DSLR Camera and it's fast enough for continuous shooting as well as 1080p 60fps video recording. I don't trust it for 4k video recording. Specially for 4k 60fps gopro recoding.Conclusion: if you're using it for Photoshoot it's a perfect value for money.For video recording of upto 1080p 60fps It have no problem in keeping up. Good enough.But for 2k120fps and 4k60fps it don't keep up with the camera in some part of the recording.The SD adaptor is not as good as samsung SD adaptor when compared (strickly in build quality, not performance)***Original Strontium product sold by Appario Retail so buy from them only. Storage space detected is the right amount.***Best buy..but I don't have received any bill on this ...I contact on Amazon and they have provided e-invoice***"

Large surface area ensures greater gripping area.","It's a very sturdy product. It fitted well in the air vents. I have been using it for a week and it holds the mobile firmly even on bumpy roads. Would highly recommend this.***The item looks good and came in a package as describedgot a car mount and two metal platesone larger rectangular and a smaller circleboth have 3M sticky tapes on their backs and can be used to stick to the mobile phone or the back coverwhen used directly with the mobile phone, the magnets work finebut when used with a thick back cover, mobile phone does not holdI have a sturdy hardback case for my motog4, and the magnets work but the strength is lessthe phone does hold but falls out when given a jerk.Go for it, if you want to use it directly on the phone,I have asked for a replacement, will try out with another piece,overall the product is good***Great product. Does its job. Holds the mobile perfectly during drive. Never fell down during drive. Fits perfectly for my Baleno.I got the product with single metal plate without 3M sticker. I called the seller in the number given in invoice. They immediately sent me two more metal plates.***Wonderful product with a superior finish and quality! Bang for the buck and I would say one of the best magnetic holders available currently. The magnets are just superior with a spectacular hold, holds my IPhone X properly with no weak links. Sweet gesture by the seller to attach a handwritten note along with the product!  Will definitely recommend it!***Update:Seller contacted me tried to know what went wrong and I told them magnet is weak. They addressed my issue and replaced product with new one. The one I am using now is better than previous one but still ill say it needs better magnet. Doesn't hold well if cover is thick hard one.3 star for product and 1 star for service.Old:Weak magnets. Doesn't hold phone on jerks. Don't buy. Total waste of money.***In short this is the best product I seen for mobile holding on AC vent with easy reachability, for detailed review you can read further --I seen in one of my friends car using this holder on AC vent, so I went for this, I am using VW Polo, this BOBO holder exactly fits in my vent and holds the mobile strong and firm in city roads with bumps and shakes, I am using Moto G6, in fact I have just put the metal plate in between my mobile case and mobile back not sticked yet still then it holds nicely, easy to rotate mobile any direction, happy to select contacts and look for directions on maps, a complete handy accessible for mobile holder with easy reachability, only negative for those who need strong cool air then this may block the way of cool air if you put your mobile on the holder, for me it is not an issue as I don't like cool breeze hitting all the time at face. Other one to consider is that it leaves some circle impression on the place where your holder touch the plastic surface below the AC vent, so I keep this in centre blade of the vent and with phone weight it will fall down slightly as vent designed to turn up and down, with the weight you need to place it properly so the vent will not face down completely and also phone will not fall off.***Update: Vendor sent me a new piece saying old lot had magnet issues. New one is definitely better but had to just stick the metal plate on the outer surface of cover. Would have ideally loved to have the plate not showing up outside.Earlier: Not able to fit properly in the ac vents of my Rapid and then not able to hold on to my S9 securely. Phone keeps falling off***Their CS reached out and provided help by replacing my product. Felt glad!Initial review:I mounted this on my Jazz with MiA2 phone. Magnet is not powerful enough to hold the phone in place. It keeps falling off and now I am scouting for better solution. Don't be deceived by the reviews this product has, I was surely deceived :(***"

The base unit should have a speaker too. Neither it has speaker button on handset unit. This makes it useless. The ringer speaker is at the backside of handset unit.

Surprise packaging with the phone on the outside. This is good for keeping on shelves to attract buyers but not good when being parcelled.It came only with the Amazon plastic cover with no bubbles inside. I was surprised as it could have got damaged on transit but thankfully it was intact.The screen isn't glass I feel and so likely to get scratched easily. The buttons are smooth and came with full battery. Will review once I insert sim & SD card. For now, the phone is good. But poor packaging by Amazon.11th April 2019Call clarity is good & so also is the clarity clear once you keep it on loudspeaker. Battery is good too & no issues otherwise.***This is my first Lava Product in Basic Phone Category.....I had purchase at price 1146/- only.At this price Nothing is bad except you cannot transfer or share your contact from other phone.All features are good, White and gold colour combinations is awesome.....Required Nano SIM in both the slot...You can use upto 32 GB Memory card.....Ringtones are limited but you can use from Memory Card......***Great basic phone with vibration features and 2.4 inch screen.***Worth the price......I am using it as a beater phone...

But in this price range it's a bit disappointing... Call clarity is good but u should type each contacts separately there is no contact importing feature. Not worth money ☹️☹️ it's seen in Amazon's page that it has 1yr warranty but in the box it's printed 2yrs warranty I'm happy with it😊***If You want to Buy TYPE PHONE then this is the BEst at this PRice ...BIG SCREEN, LOOKS GOOD , AUDIO QUALITY IS GOODFAR BETTER THAN SAMSUNG & NOKIA  at this pRicE***Excellent voice quality.Worth buying.Go for it.***"

It has dimensions of 118.4 (H) x 53.2 (W) x 12.6 (T) mm. Preloaded apps namely - Calculator, Stopwatch, Calendar and Alarm are found in this device for utility purposes. Entertainment, Camera and Storage FM and MP3 audio songs act as a source of recreation for the users. The device is stacked with a 2MP camera. For saving more number of files, the storage capacity can be increased upto 8GB using a microSD card. Battery and Connectivity In order to keep the show running for long hours, there is a 1,200mAh li-ion battery which renders good amount of battery backup. In terms of connectivity, the device supports dual SIM, 2G and Bluetooth. Verdict The Gfive Z15 is a dual SIM handset with a good battery backup. It is available in a wide range of colours and easy to carry around, since it is light in weight. The camera clicks great pictures from the point of view of a basic phone, however a larger expandable memory would have been a better option.","Loud speaker, 4 sim, 4 sim standbyLong standby 3000 mah battery, 2.4"" inch bright displayOpen fm, led tourch, vga cameraSize: 2.4 inches","I think compared to W1, W1+ has(1) 3.5 mm audio jack instead of 2.5 mm.(2) 2.4"" display instead of 2.2""(3) Call-recordingPhone looks & feels sturdy, but some very basic features are absent.  Some of which are...(1) No scheduled power on/off.(2) No wireless FM, No FM recording.(3) Does not support phonebook import & export.(4) No internal memory at all.(5) Max. blacklist is 20. Call attempts from blacklisted numbers not displayed.(6) Auto call records only incoming calls, not outgping.(7) Very very basic camera without flash.(8) Calling party voice is low.(9) Display white background is very bright & sounds are too loud.Inspite of features absent as mentioned above, I think it suits people who need to carry multiple numbers with them & need longer battery standby. It has been 4+ days since it was fully charged, and kept in powersave mode during day and flight mode during nights (lesser power consumption). With no calls, only in standby mode, out of the 8 steps in the battery indicator, it currently stands at 5.  I think, it it ok.***Great battery life last long for one week and more as per usage.

Corning glass supports an 88.4 percent screen ratio, providing resistance to scratches, while offering a more immersive experience. We apply the concept of contrasting beauty in aesthetics to product design, bringing together two trendy colours, Glaring Gold and Glaze Blue. A first in the industry, the 3D heat-curved sheet and grating pattern on the back mirrored texture casing creates a premium look, in concert with the polished feel in the central frame. Anti-reflective coating is added to the A7 to increase the overall screen brightness by 35 percent - the view looks good whichever angle you look at. Also, a low-voltage backlight reduces the phone temperature by 0.5 °C while a magnesium alloy allows the battery to dissipate heat more efficiently. All these efforts contributes to a better handgrip. A huge 4230mAh battery capacity frees you from the concern of battery drain during your day. Moreover, smart and thoughtful AI battery management freezes inactive apps and reduces excess caching to save more power.","13MP+2MP dual rear camera with AI beauty, HDR, background blur, sticker, filter | 16MP front facing camera15.8 centimeters (6.2-inch) HD + in-cell capacitive touchscreen with 1520 x 720 pixels resolution, 270 ppi pixel density and 16M color supportMemory, Storage & SIM: 3GB RAM | 64GB storage expandable up to 256GB | Dual nano SIM with dual standby (4G+4G)Android v8.1 Oreo based on Color OS 5.2 operating system with 1.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 octa core processor, Adreno 506 GPU4230mAH lithium-polymer battery providing talk-time of 32 hours and standby time of 410 hours1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchaseBox also includes: Screen Protector (pre-applied), Back-cover, Charge Adapter, USB Cable, SIM Tray Ejector, Booklet with Warranty Card and Quick GuideFor any product related queries contact_us on: [1800-103-2777]",Poor mobile.

I purchased this less than a month ago. Haven’t installed any major 3rd party apps and still this phone is troubling me. It shuts down automatically and then it becomes a huge problem to restart this phone because everytime you restart it, it switches off again that very moment. At this very time when I am writing the review, the phone is not even restarting now. My money is wasted. This phone is not worth buying. Don’t waste your hard earned money on this phone.***I am a fan of Moto G series mainly due to its durability and have been using it since its introduction. But Moto E5 Plus disappointed me badly. A minor drop on the floor resulted in a damaged screen within one month of purchase. The 5000mAh battery also started draining very quickly within the same period even with normal usage. There are a no of other brands available for the same price, so choose wisely.***Mobile has hang issue and front camera quality is bad and it hang during the phase change.i.e. from back to front camera. phone heats during the call and charging . I requested to amazon for return but they are denying for return.Only one option I have to go to consumer court.***Nice product.Good mobile Excellent.***Screen cracked automatically***Battery drain very quick,it didn't last even 5hrs but in the add its showing that 18hrs of playback time. Lol 🤣....Other draw backs.1.Rapid charging ( just for attention only never mind) even it takes more than 6hrs to charge to get 100%*note when the phone is off.2.face detection wont work and about the finger print reader,may be work some times like oru indian govt. 😅3.lock buttons & Volume buttons in wrong position.4.I bought this phone on 27th nov and returned back , The funny thing is it didn't even detect the sim card ,networks ,and even wifi .... Hihi***I've been using this mobile for more than a month now. It is very handy. I love big phones with good camera and this phone really suits my need. The storage capacity and the power of the battery makes it a best phone than the ones I've been using before.***Highly satisfied with its performance till date and its Battery Life***"

The packaging of the product was nice and as per Amazon advt. The product was in a sealed pack and new one. I received a handset, base station, charging adapter and 2 nos. rechargeable AAA cells along with a operation manual and  a bill. There was no signed warranty card inside from the seller. Regarding the quality of the product, it is still working fine after constant use of last 60 days. The sound quality is fine. There is a speaker phone mode, though the sound is not that loud. There is no backlit display on the dialpad. The range is very good and easily covering my whole villa of 2500 Sq. Ft. without diminishing the quality. There is no interference with adjacent modem or other electronic gadgets around on the voice quality. But the base station must be always connected to power line, most preferably to UPS, otherwise there will be no incoming or outgoing call even if the handset runs on rechargeable batteries. There is no requirement of always keeping the handset connected to base station while not in use. The handset runs 48 hrs even if u don't charge it. For the first time use, u need to charge it for 7 hrs minimum. The display LED is clear and shows the incoming and outgoing calls. Phonebook software is very low grade and not much user friendly. There is a call and charging alert LED on top of the handset. The ringtones are not that loud and may not be audible from distance. The handset and the base station should be kept away from dust, otherwise it creates trouble in charging. Charging connectors must be kept clean. Another big issue is the after sales service. There are a very few service centres of Panasonic authorised for handset service. The common service centres of Panasonic for TV, refrigerators etc. in your city won't entertain complaint for the cordless handset if any. So, be mentally prepared beforehand if you are NOT residing in major metro cities. The phone overall performance is good till now as expected from a low budget cordless phone. But regarding after sales service do not expect much as support.***The range I pathetic! its a very very very bad product. I would suggest not wasting your money on this. It does not even give a proper range of 10 feet! its not really cordless if you are unable to talk from anywhere you want. Standing next the receiver hardly qualifies as cordless. Its a joke!***Beware! This phone literally doesn't work without electric supply despite having batteries. It's like having a nice cordless landline which turns into a dead-phone when there is a power cut at home. Here are some drawbacks that made me send the product back: (1) display light cannot be controlled and is lit for only 5 - 10 seconds, (2) ringer volume isn't that great, (3) speaker is not loud enough as you would expect, (4) the battery charge drains very quickly, (end). And yeah, the only cool thing about this phone is the Sci-Fi sound that it makes when you're on a call with someone and the power gets cut. I bet you'll like it.***I am reviewing this product after 2 years of use . Even today it is working fine and no problem encountered so far.Sound quality - clear and crispNetwork quality -greatBattery backup - Average ,not that greatFunction/Features - not too many features , have only some basic features ,like that time setting , save contract numbers up to 100  ,10 types of ringtone etc .It’s receiver doesn’t not have any battery backup this works only if power supply continue. So  plug it in socket that have inverter supply .MY OVERALL RATING FOR THIS PHONE IS 7.5 OUT OF 10***This is an ok product , not a great one .I purchased it because we live in a duplex house and the base station is at the ground floor while parent live on the first floor. The overall build quality of the product is good and the has decent battery life but there are some issues .If you have older people in the house , and they will primarily use this , then this is not a good choice as the audio from the headset is NOT LOUD ENOUGH , so older people will have trouble understanding what is being said without turning on the hands free loudspeaker mode.Similarly the the fonts on the LCD display are too small for senior citizens to read .buy only if the primary users have young sharp ears and good eyesight.***Best for making your landline wireless.Has good range.Battery lasts upto a day without rechargingNo need wasting money buying other costly wireless handsets.This does the job, that too elegantly.Have been using for almost 2 years now***Purchased this product but after 1month the battery doesn't fully charge spite of charging it whole night, it will show 3 bars in the display but once u lift it it will show 1 bar asking to reconnect to the base for charging.... The voice quality is good when we purchased, only issue is with the charging. May be I have been give a bad battery.***Great product. sound quality and voice quality both are good. I am living in a 2 BHK flat so ringing bell and range is also not a problem for me.P.S. I am sharing this review after one month of purchasing this product.***"

After several tests i got a final conclusion about the malfunctioning of the headphone. This headphone is specifically made for Android devices. If u somehow use with your loving laptop and any device for a single time u gonna damage it. Dont know why this happens but its true. So use it only on your android phones and enjoy the deep bass of this amazing headphone. For any queries contact me sajukaif@gmail.com***Nit a good product!

The OS is simple and lag free, basic functions like the camera and music player work as expected. The music player is a little too bare-bones for my liking but it's still passable at this price. Call quality is good, battery life is pretty good as well, and it recognises 4G sim cards albeit it doesn't really support 4G call quality or even the internet!Overall this phone is great for minimalists, the elderly, or really anyone looking for a digital detox.***I bought if for my father and from next day on wards it is automatically switching off in every 4-5 minutes. He could not use it and is very upset and frustrated. We have place the order to replace it.  I feel the old NOKIA is no more....that quality gone. I will recommend not to buy it.***OK if all you want is a basic feature phone for voice calls and messaging. Voice quality is not really great - so may not be useful for seniors. Phone finish and looks are average.***I chose Nokia over others for simple UI, its durability, quality and battery backup based on  performance of my old Nokia basic phones which even today are functioning without any flaws. But since Nokia has handed over its  handset production  to HMD global the quality of Nokia products especially feature phones have declined. This product Nokia 150 disappoints in every aspect like battery backup (3-4 days max in standby and 2 days if you do some calling and  play music ),camera quality(even  jiophone has better quality ,Nokia 150 will capture ghost out of you) and every thing for which i purchased it. At same or cheaper price other companies are offering better features like inbuilt call recorder , 3000mah battery with power bank feature. what is use of durability when performance is poor. I do not recommend it for basic phone user. Go for Samsung if you are using 2G network or better go for jiophone (which i have tried and tested).Regarding the  seller i.e Appario retail, they didn't mention any of the two IMEI Numbers without  which warranty can't be claimed instead they have mentioned  one IMEI number in 'order summary' where it has been clearly written that it can not be presented as an invoice. Such carelessness from highly rated seller. Soon will contact Amazon cust. Care. For that and for future purchases of mobile handsets, i will make sure before buying that seller mentions atleast one IMEI no. In tax invoice or serial no. in cade of other electronic items.Thanks.***This was classified as a Sr. Citizen mobile and I purchased it for an elderly person. While the mobile is good, simple operation, etc. IT CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS A SENIOR CITIZEN MOBILE - THE KEYS ARE TOO SMALL, SCREEN FONT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER, THERE IS NO SINGLE TOUCH DIALING AND NO DISTRESS CALL BUTTON. DISAPPOINTED SINCE THIS IS BEING TOUTED AS A SR. CITIZEN MOBILE BY ALL.***this is an excellent basic phone. I bought it for my mother. Using the phone is quiet easy. battery back up is excellent overall phone can be recommend for new purchase***I'm fully satisfied with my new Nokia 150 . It withstand my all the expectation. But don't expect a lot from it as Nokia can't give a lot of features in this price it. It's rings for few seconds and then the call gets rejected. camera is of standard quality .These were the only drawbacks of this phone, otherwise the phone is fabulous and gives that nostalgic feeling like other Nokia phones give.***I am using small phone besides my smartphone. My old nokia got damaged after 6 yrs so i opted for nokia again. But when compared to quality with old nokia its not standing anywhere. Very disaapointing from Nokia. Functions which were simple made complicated.***"

Works flawlessly. Am using it for intercom of the building which means that it is used several times a day since I bought it. The LED lights glow whence is being used and when there is an incoming call. The buttons have a great tactile feel and easy for any size of fingers to be used. The sound quality is great and has consistently worked well since a year now. The phone is compact and light weight, does not use much space for its placement. Works well in narrow spaces. The combination of metal & plastic used is good, so is the finish which doesn’t show any deterioration at all after using for 1 year. Strongly recommended product.***badddd! just looks nice; but once you start using u realize that its so light in weight that the whole phone comes up with the receiver:-)...also wall hanging doesnt work coz the handset falls off...thats so so stupid design. there is no lock to keep the handset in place.DON'T BUY!!!***The phone is good but the photos here can be quite misleading. The photos here have been adjusted and the colors look more vivid. It's not as brown as it appears and in fact the earpiece is more copper colored than bronze.The phone quality is fine, light weight.

Got delivered on 24th December 2018.First let me tell you about the pricing and amazon delivery:Pricing:I got this phone for around 20K INR. Yes after selling my old phone (moto g4 plus - 3 year old for 4k, and instant discount of 1700 and no cost EMI discount of 1500) . For this price I think i got the best deal for such an amazing phone.Delivery: Yes, as promised it was a one day delivery with good packaging. Thank you Amazon.The actual review of the phone:About me: I work as a software engineer who uses all the basic apps one uses on a day to day basis and also I dont play games on mobile phones. So, I dont know how PUBG runs on this device.BUILD: Man, its built like a tank. It just screams premium once you hold it in your hand. You can clearly see the difference between a Chinese phone and a Nokia phone. Its clearly visible. Hats off to Nokia in this department. Actually for the first two weeks I could not get a screen guard and phone cover and I used this phone without them and it fell off from my hands twice, but nothing happened. Not even a scratch. But i recommend buying a cover as the phone is slippery. The best part, even the camera is covered with gorilla glass on the back, so your lens wont have any scratches. There is a YouTube video which shows how nothing happens to this phone even when it falls from 10 feet high. So BUILD: 10/10.BATTERY: When i read the ad which says two day battery life, i was like : this must be a gimmick or marketing strategy. But, i was wrong. The phone indeed gives me a two day battery life with heavy to moderate usage. I keep my mobile data on 24/7 (Airtel 4G). So no complains in this department as well (i dont play games). Screenshot attached of battery usage.SCREEN:  Watching HDR content on this phone is awesome. I watched some Netflix shows on this phone and the contrast levels and blacks were so deep. Auto brightness works as expected. Really a good screen, photos and videos looks great on this device, nothing more to say.CAMERA: Wow, this phone USP is its camera. Really blown away with the picture quality in all conditions. Bokeh mode is very good, low light conditions is good, and with good lighting conditions is even better. Beats oneplus 6t camera. Check YouTube. Attached a sample pic. Really impressed with the camera.PERFORMANCE: Coupled with stock android one software and snapdragon 710, no lags whatsoever enough said.RAM management: Could be improved, i see apps getting refreshed after 20-30 mins of standby. May be owing to 4GB RAM, but guys trust you wont notice any difference or lag. Its good.SOUND: The single speaker at the bottom is good, but it can be easily muted once you have it blocked with a finger. Well, i use the provided headset or my wireless headset. So, no issues for me here.And finally, its an absolute beast. I love this product, worth my money, and I really dont care about the notches. I dont get annoyed by it. I like it, it gives you more screen space. This phone has some software bugs (very minor issues), hope it gets fixed in the Jan security update. Android one phones are best!People who are planning to buy a Oneplus phone : think again, do you need 6GB of RAM? and snap dragon 845 ? This phone has got a better camera and a better build and the RAM and processor are more than enough from a day to day usage point of view, and a better brand of course. So, consider this phone before going for oneplus.Just go for it, you wont regret.***Do not Compare it with Poco F1, Nokia 8.1 shines in its own way.  Buy this, only if have following requirements1) High-quality camera with excellent low light performance2) Premium Design3) Stock Android.4) Good Responsiveness.5) occasional gaming.6) Good Battery backup of nearly 2days on normal use.***After using phone for 5 days my overall opinion is that it is an excellent phone.Pros:1) Snapdragon 710 is very good. No lags even with many apps open.2) display is great.3) Size is appropriate.4) Rear camera is super fast. Click fantastic snaps.5) Android one is good. No bloatware.6) sound quality is very good even with single speaker at bottom.7) Call quality is excellent.However few missess1) Slippery due to glass at back,  need back case.2) Battery lasts one day with 5 -6 h on screen time.3) Front camera need improvements.4) No splash proof (if not IP rating)5) many essential apps such as compass, calculator, GPS, notes, connection speed missing.6) Nokia service centres are not up to the mark in providing quick and satisfactory service.So far so good, Price should be in the range of 21000 to 23000.***1. Touch is smooth but not very smooth. I am using oneplus 6T also which has much smoother touch.2. Battery life is awesome. Screen time is approx 10 hrs for normal use. Standby is close to 5 days.3. Charging is not too fast. It takes 120 mins to charge from 0 to 100 but still very decent.4. Slight heating issues while using camera and shooting long videos.5. Yes it heats up while playing PUBG and any mobile will. Good thing is no lags whatsoever.6. Earphones provided along with the mobile has good sound. They look premium and comfortable to wear.7. It comes with Snapdragon 710. Performance is good though you cant compare with Snapdragon 845 processor. OnePlus 6T is superfast.8. Camera is unbeatable. Very very good. Beats oneplus easily. Front camera shows real colour and images are sharp and same is true for Rear camera.9. Very durable. Awesome build quality. But the back glass is not scratch resistant. It easily get minor scratches.10. Back surface is slippery so you definitely need a case or cover.11. Back glass is a finger magnet.12. Usb type c cord is about 1 meter long.13. Speakers are okay. Not too attractive. Loud enough to use it in bathroom.14. No I dont recommend this phone at a price point of Rs 27000. Its price should not be around Rs 20000.15. No face unlock feature yet.16. If you use two sims, battery backup will be reduced by 35 percent.17. Metal paint on the sides is chipping off in 8 days of usage. So get a cover asap.***Waited more than a month to get this here in India and it's been worth it.Pros:1) Awesome display (better than op6).2) Great battery life (1 day plus with heavy usage).3) Flawless build quality and design.4) Camera is excellent in daylight. Good in low light as well if you use flash.5) No real difference in performance in day to day usage compared to OP 6.6) Call quality is excellent.7) While the speaker's positioning could have been better, it is quite loud.8) The in box earphones are one of the most comfortable I've ever used and can get very loud.9) Android one.10) Colorado: Iron/Silver is amazing.Cons:1) It's not a Nokia thing but an Android pie thing, the home/recent button being the same is a little frustrating.Overall, I'm glad I waited for it :D***"

Cell phone arm band and phone holder for GYM bag are fully tested before","I am a fitness freak so daily go to a morning walk and a 1.5km run on a round ground. As we all use our mobile phones daily and we need our songs calls and many people uses for km ,time taken, calories burnt etc but the main thing is where should we keep our cell phones its not always to carry a bag while running or to keep the phone in shorts pocket as it starts jumping in shorts or track pant pocket so i got a thought to buy this pouch.The following are points I observed after using 3 days while running:-* The pouch is soft so that it doest hurt our skin while running or any kind of rubbibg with pouch.* The pouch strip which grips the phone pouch with our arm is good enough to hold if any big jerk met us while running.* The pouch is big enough to have my nokia 6.1 plus which is 5.8"" screen and as per specification it can hold 6.3"" inches.* The pouch has one more pocket to carry your cash money ,card or house keys.* The pouch's fabric is good enough that it doesnt make you sweat in your arm while running .* I havnt checked for waterproofing effect but yes my sweat doesnt touch my phones and my cash money.* As now carrying phone becomes easy so i have started running more without think much about phones safety.*********************************Verdict :- On an average we have our phone costs around 10k - 20k and I bought this pouch at 499 bucks. If you think i have wasted my money, No i have invested in the safety of my phone ,as if the local pouch looses its grip and my phone breaks down then i have to buy a new one which is then called as a wastage of money.***i personally recommend this product . its quality is very good ,it is sturdy , do not move while running,you can easily put your phone and money in it. It even has a small hole for you headphones ,if you go for morning walk/Jogging this product  is definately usefull to you***Its a Solid product and doesn't move as you run .Its stays intact even if u run faster also it has other pockets to keep some cash and card and without having to carry a wallet while u jog.***I chose this because it is made of neoprene. Neoprene has fair amount of elasticity compared to nylon and hence it will hold the phone tight. This pouch will be suitable for few sizes of phones.  The main pouch accommodated Asus 5.5 inches with Armor Cover and the secondary pouch held HTC M8 also with Armor cover. Neoprene is easily washable. Good finishing and strong Velcro. Pics attached. Recommended.***This is a suitable product for tech geeks andfor those who participates in outdoor activities. It can perfectly hold my ""Honor 9 lite"" and some of my other stuff like cards and earphones as well as my powerbank. It can also be used as a hard drive cover. I hope this review will help u all in making a right decision.***Loved the fitting of the band and it is very spacious. It has space for money, keys, phone, etc. It doesn't slip off the hand it stays put. The quality is very nice too.***This is an extremely useful and Handy Arm Band Holder. Much better than it's pictures, the quality of this pouch is too good. It is sturdy, water resistant and you can now carry your phone, iPods, keys, money on the go while you jog or travel around.It's very comfortable to wear and can easily adjust on your arms. It is a value for money product and a must buy for carefree fitness on the go.***This mobile case is very handy and usefull while jogging.Few weeks i has started jogging and was difficult to carry phone ,keys or a little cash but this pouch made my life very easy.I can easily carry my phone and other stuff.Its even water proof and made from very good quality material.It fitts very easily in my arm so its easy to carry***"

This is more for the personal sim which is linked to my Aadhar/Bank accounts/Gas/Electricity/School etc.  hence I wanted a phone that would not require frequent charging and be on always to receive all messages.  This phone is just too good for that with its big battery.Here are the impressions after its usage.Pros:Very stylish and rugged looking phone.Good battery life (3600 mah).Good music output (clarity and volume is also good)Nice torch with a dedicated button for it.Large keypad displayFM is good as it can tune into stations with better clarity than my smartphone.They say it as ""easy fm"" but it still needs the headphones to be inserted.  Not wireless FM.Has a USB power out hence can be used a power bank if requiredSupports SD card upto 32 GB for all the music you need.Also because of the USB cable support, you can connect it to the computer and do the file transfer/editing etc realtimeTriple sim facility with dedicated button for easy sim selection (i have used only one sim)consWhile every thing else is loud on this phone (ringtone, sms ringtone, fm, music player) the call volume is not that loud.  I am sure you will have trouble in having a conversation out in the busy/noisy streets.Though it has a front and rear camera, both are useless to say the least as in this age of smartphone cameras, this output will not leave anyone satisfied.I used the powerbank feature once and felt the battery was draining out fast hence do not recommend this as a powerbank substitute.  In an emergency, it will double up as one.It is heavy as it is bulky.  Cannot carry it in the shirt pocket.To remove the battery or insert a sim / sd card you would need to carry its tool to screw and unscrew the cover. If ever the phone goes into a hang, and you would need to remove the battery then it would be a pain without the screwdriver.Phone book has a memory of 500 numbers only.  Then you will have to store it in the sim/s.No great choice of default ringtones/alarm***MERITS:sound is awsom..torch light is awsom..battery backup is awsom..speed is awsome...less price..easy button..DEMERITS:big size..weight is hight..slow internet ..overall satisfied..***Good product long lasting battery***The product is not as per the image that I saw. In the image the brand name shows as MIDO and actually it is Kechaoda. The size of the phone is comparatively too big then the image. There are 4 screws to open the back panel to put the 3 SIM and the battery. The body of phone is literally made up of plastic, cheap plastic. The colour of the phone is nice and the torch output is too good and this sound quality is pretty awesome..you can also charge ur another Android phone because it has a power bank which is good***Heavier and it's so bulky not slim as shown in the picture***No good***It's good***Product is ok for the money paid.***"

This is more for the personal sim which is linked to my Aadhar/Bank accounts/Gas/Electricity/School etc.  hence I wanted a phone that would not require frequent charging and be on always to receive all messages.  This phone is just too good for that with its big battery.Here are the impressions after its usage.Pros:Very stylish and rugged looking phone.Good battery life (3600 mah).Good music output (clarity and volume is also good)Nice torch with a dedicated button for it.Large keypad displayFM is good as it can tune into stations with better clarity than my smartphone.They say it as ""easy fm"" but it still needs the headphones to be inserted.  Not wireless FM.Has a USB power out hence can be used a power bank if requiredSupports SD card upto 32 GB for all the music you need.Also because of the USB cable support, you can connect it to the computer and do the file transfer/editing etc realtimeTriple sim facility with dedicated button for easy sim selection (i have used only one sim)consWhile every thing else is loud on this phone (ringtone, sms ringtone, fm, music player) the call volume is not that loud.  I am sure you will have trouble in having a conversation out in the busy/noisy streets.Though it has a front and rear camera, both are useless to say the least as in this age of smartphone cameras, this output will not leave anyone satisfied.I used the powerbank feature once and felt the battery was draining out fast hence do not recommend this as a powerbank substitute.  In an emergency, it will double up as one.It is heavy as it is bulky.  Cannot carry it in the shirt pocket.To remove the battery or insert a sim / sd card you would need to carry its tool to screw and unscrew the cover. If ever the phone goes into a hang, and you would need to remove the battery then it would be a pain without the screwdriver.Phone book has a memory of 500 numbers only.  Then you will have to store it in the sim/s.No great choice of default ringtones/alarm***MERITS:sound is awsom..torch light is awsom..battery backup is awsom..speed is awsome...less price..easy button..DEMERITS:big size..weight is hight..slow internet ..overall satisfied..***Good product long lasting battery***The product is not as per the image that I saw. In the image the brand name shows as MIDO and actually it is Kechaoda. The size of the phone is comparatively too big then the image. There are 4 screws to open the back panel to put the 3 SIM and the battery. The body of phone is literally made up of plastic, cheap plastic. The colour of the phone is nice and the torch output is too good and this sound quality is pretty awesome..you can also charge ur another Android phone because it has a power bank which is good***Heavier and it's so bulky not slim as shown in the picture***No good***It's good***Product is ok for the money paid.***"

Some come off easily, especially the ones I wanted to stick on the dashboard. Then I tried this product on the windshield. I have been using it since last two months. No major issues at all. The screws underneath may need to be tightened a little bit, perhaps every 2 weeks, if one wants to avoid a little rattling sound. It's ok for 99%, but I usually become annoyed even with the slightest rattling sounds in my car.I tried to fix it in the middle of the windshield, but there was an annoying blindspot and the arm wasn't lengthy enough. So I tried to stick it in the right bottom part of the windshield, and now working just fine. I have seen reviews that it is also good for the dashboard, but I didn't wanna test my chances. I also bought a long charging cable, which reaches the phone perfectly.***This is an extremely poor quality product. The material is flimsy and I actually had to return the first one I ordered to get a replacement. But even the replacement feels so delicate in your hands that you will worry about tightening the screws, thinking they might break. The sticking of the base is good and it holds on to the car dash decently, but the mobile holder is just plain bad. There's not enough cushioning for the phone and so a small bump and the phone will pop right out of it and fall down. India is famous for it's bumpy roads and this product will work only if you are using it not on a road. The button to release is also located right behind the phone so if you accidentally put a little more pressure while operating the phone, it will open the clamps and again the phone will fall right down. My phone got damaged due to the multiple falls. If you are using a costly phone, I request you spend some money on buying a good car mount and recommend you buy something else.***It's one of the best mobile holder available in the market. Value for money is great, it's very easy to install and use. The material is high quality and looks stylish and feels good. Don't worry about reviews with low ratings, this is a great product for people who love their cars***Very nice product, quality is good. What make it different from other holders is, it works on dashboard. Using it from 1 month, no issue till now. u can rotate it to horizontal position also if you want to enjoy some videos while driving, but you should be alert also at the same time :D***Good adhesion, very flexible to use! Flawless functionality day after day! Go for it.I just loved the fact that putting the mobile is so easy on this.One update after more than year: a part of plastic broke which was to help the arm's height adjustment. So the arm is in its lowest position now. Although, the stand is still usable***It has a good build quality and I found the following issues1. arm length is not enough. If you need to place the holder on the dashboard and need the phone below the dashboard, just to avoid distraction, the arm length is not enough.2. If you park your car under the sun for an hour and then start driving, the holder will fall. Somehow the vacuum holder is not working. Again we have to fix it on the dashboard***I was confused with the multiple different reviews about the product. It's one of the best mobile holder available in the market. Value for money is great, it's very easy to install and use. The material is high quality and looks stylish and feels good as the price.  What make it different from other holders is, it works on dashboard. Good Grip.Flexible to use! Flawless functionality day after day! Go for it.***"

Can be clamped / unclamped onto any vent as and when required.2. Very sturdy and tight fitting which holds mobile even in the worst jerks / bumps.3. Size is perfect. Neither too big, nor too small.4. Better than the traditional sticky/suction fitting like many dashboard/glass mobile holders which tend to become loose after a certain period of time, or can get even get opened from heavy jerks.5. Chose not to go for magnetic holders as the magnet power might reduce over time.Very happy with the product and would definitely recommend to everyone. Hope the images I attached will be helpful for you.***Using it for a week now. Wanted a ac vent fixated mobile holder, hence this choice. Was not sure of the vacuum cup type of holder which i thought may not withstand our pot holed roads. It is made of good plastic material. Looks decent enough. It has 2 locking positions, one for thin vent and another for thick. It fixes only on horizontal ac vents. I have one plus 6 phone and it holds it very well. It can hold phones of 3.5 inches width and more. It has soft resting pads for the gadget. I liked the release button, which when pressed, moves the side grips sideways to release the phone for removal. Feels as if it is a hydraulic release. Only con i see is that the AUX port of the phone gets blocked by the 'bottom rest' of the device. To use the AUX port of phone one has to fix it upside down. Not a big deal. All said, i would highly recommend this clamp.***After going through 100s of products available online, I went for this as it had a decent rating and more importantly was not magnet based. Though the manufacturers claim that the magnet based holders do not damage the phone, expert opinion points at least the compass in the phone being affected (and the main purpose of me using the holder would be to use while viewing maps - with a defective compass that would not be possible).Installation: very very easy to install. Has two locking options based on the size of the air vent. There is a nut on the backside using which one can adjust how easy/hard it should be to change the angle. I like mine to be fixee and it works fine.Grip: is good and over normal city driving in Bangalore (meaning a lot of potholes and bad roads), the phone was held firmly. The cushion in the holder helps. One push release makes it very easy to use.Only con so far is that there is a slight rattle in the car after fixing it. Need to check if I can eliminate this somehow.***Very cheap product with this I've lost my ac wings***This is a nice product, the plastic quality is amazing, but unfortunately I had to return it because this did not it my Duster car AC vent. I wish the suppliers specify the variant of the car the product is supposed to fit!!!!!***After a long research I purchased this mobile holder and giving a review after travelling more than 500 km fitting this device in my car.It perfectly fits all of  air vents, have an excellent locking system. The back push button works fine and extends the holding arms to take out your mobile/GPS set.It's far better than any vaccum type holder that sticks to the windshield which mwy have chances to detach while travelling bumpy roads or on strong sunlight or may loose its capacity with time. Also doesnt provide any view obstacle as you can place it in a vent which is comfortable to view while driving.If you are a person who frequently uses GPS or have to take call while driving you can purchase it without a second thought. It is serving its purpose 100%for which it is designed.I have put 4stars and not 5 only for a single reason. When it is fitted to a horizontal vent and you put you your mobile, due to weight of the mobile the horizontal vent framework (which are adjusted for airflow - up n down) tilts a little downward directing the air flow of that vent downwards. But keeping that aside it is a perfect product for all types of road condition.***The portronics mobile holder is a useful device for use in car. It holds on to AC vents tightly. The suction type mobile holders with base sticking to glass or dashboard cannot be guaranteed to work due to wide variations of temperature in Indian Summer and winter. So this is a natural choice. But still it is not perfect as if AC vents point downwards then under the weight of mobile the holder also falls off. So if you keep AC vents upwards no trouble in using it.***After having used many of the similar products from Road Side stuff to branded ones from accessories shops, found this to be much more practical than those vacuum based ones.The material used is good and worth a brand like Portronics. Would've appreciated it at four hundred bucks instead of four four nine, but still would be ok if it lasts more than an year or so of regular use.***"
